What an a-hole!</p><p>I could, maybe, understand if she hadn't been there long, or she had joint time with her own dad.

We&nbsp;have some tips that we&nbsp;hope can be&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>Open a&nbsp;candid conversation with your husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/71e/3b2/e0c8f35fa68adf3f0c719462e4.jpeg><p>Sit down with your husband and have an <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>honest conversation</strong></a><strong> </strong>about how his refusal to contribute to your daughter’s graduation gift made you feel. Explain the<strong> significance of the gift </strong>and why you believe it’s fair given the precedent he set with his own daughter.</p><p>Highlight how <strong>his actions have impacted your perception of his </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>commitment</strong></a> to your blended family. This might help him understand your perspective and possibly lead to a resolution.</p><p><h2>Involve a&nbsp;family counselor.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/237/338/0b018352b8a21c482e7bd7b37f.jpg><p>Given the ongoing tensions and unresolved feelings, it might be beneficial to involve <strong>a family </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>counselor</strong></a>. A professional can help mediate the conversation, allowing both you and your husband to <strong>express your feelings in a controlled environment</strong>.</p><p>This can also provide a platform to<strong> address any deeper issues in your relationship </strong>and work on building a more cohesive family dynamic.</p><p><h2>Establish clear financial boundaries and expectations.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/124/082/9de6855e728527af2913da991d.jpg><p>Moving forward, it could be helpful to establish clear<strong> </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>financial boundaries</strong></a><strong> and expectations </strong>within your family. Create <strong>a plan </strong>for how expenses, especially significant ones like gifts for children, will be handled.</p><p>This can <strong>prevent future misunderstandings </strong>and ensure that both of you are on the same page regarding financial responsibilities.</p><p><h2>Strengthen your bond with your stepdaughter.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21d/8e9/4a4bfb5c71b03f7eaf85464e2c.jpg><p>Focus on the<strong> positive relationship </strong>you have with your stepdaughter. Her supportive gesture indicates a<strong> </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>strong bond</strong></a>. Spend more time with her and <strong>acknowledge her kindness</strong>. This can create a stronger family unit and provide your daughter with a sense of fairness and support, even if it didn’t come from your husband.</p><p>Encouraging such relationships can sometimes lead to <strong>a shift in perspective from other family members</strong> over time.</p><p>Joy, another mother, found herself in an uncomfortable situation when her daughter began addressing her stepmother as "mom" instead of her.
