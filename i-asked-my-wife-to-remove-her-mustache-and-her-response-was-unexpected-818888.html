Despite being naturally beautiful, she had always struggled with excess hair on&nbsp;her body, but she diligently removed it&nbsp;for him, knowing how much it&nbsp;meant to&nbsp;him. Whenever there was even a&nbsp;hint of&nbsp;hair on&nbsp;her face, he&nbsp;would gently let her know, and she would take care of&nbsp;it. This tradition started long ago, back in&nbsp;their college days. A&nbsp;month ago, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party, she caught a&nbsp;glimpse of&nbsp;herself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;harshly lit mirror and noticed some hair on&nbsp;her upper lip.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;asked to&nbsp;remove the mustache.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6b6/2b1/a10d0c51d28cdde3058575089a.png><p>Not too long ago, he&nbsp;began to&nbsp;notice that she had stopped removing the stray hairs above her lip. Sensing a&nbsp;shift in&nbsp;their routine, he&nbsp;broached the subject gently, asking if&nbsp;she was aware of&nbsp;the change. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;moment of&nbsp;candid vulnerability, he&nbsp;confessed that the sight of&nbsp;the visible hairs irritated him, a&nbsp;truth he&nbsp;had hesitated to&nbsp;share. <strong>His wife received his admission with grace and understanding</strong>. Without judgment, she promised to&nbsp;resume her diligent grooming habits, reaffirming their commitment to&nbsp;each other’s comfort and happiness.</p><p><h2>Suddenly she started being sensitive about her mustache.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b99/365/7131a45db2a969240ca5146cf5.jpg><p>Telling her about the hair became something they did regularly. After years, it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;routine for him to&nbsp;casually say, “Babe, you need a&nbsp;trim,” and they’d share a&nbsp;laugh before she took care of&nbsp;it. But a&nbsp;week ago, when he&nbsp;mentioned it&nbsp;again, things took an&nbsp;unexpected turn. Instead of&nbsp;laughing it&nbsp;off like usual, <strong>she burst into tears</strong>. She told him he&nbsp;was being rude by&nbsp;pointing it&nbsp;out.</p><p>This left him feeling puzzled and worried. He&nbsp;tried talking to&nbsp;her, even apologizing, but she remained upset. He&nbsp;couldn’t understand what had changed. It&nbsp;was frustrating not knowing what he&nbsp;had done wrong. They had been doing this for nearly 15&nbsp;years, and there were times when she had been mad at&nbsp;him for forgetting to&nbsp;mention the hair. But this time, it&nbsp;felt different, and he&nbsp;couldn’t shake the feeling of&nbsp;unease.</p><p><h2>What statistics say about female body hair.</h2></p><p>Women, collectively, harbor a&nbsp;secret burden. It’s a&nbsp;matter so&nbsp;deeply shrouded in&nbsp;shame that many keep it&nbsp;concealed from both friends and partners. The struggle is&nbsp;often so&nbsp;consuming that considerable time and resources are devoted to&nbsp;masking&nbsp;it. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;2006 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>study</a> conducted in&nbsp;Britain, women, on&nbsp;average, <strong>dedicate 104 minutes per week to&nbsp;managing their facial hair</strong>. A&nbsp;significant portion of&nbsp;these women habitually check their facial hair in&nbsp;mirrors and through tactile examination.</p><p>This facial hair dilemma exacts an&nbsp;emotional toll. A&nbsp;considerable number of&nbsp;women feel uneasy in&nbsp;social settings due to&nbsp;it, and a&nbsp;<strong>staggering&nbsp;75% experience heightened levels of&nbsp;anxiety</strong>. Despite generally reporting a&nbsp;satisfactory quality of&nbsp;life, they struggle particularly with their social interactions and relationships. It’s worth noting that having some facial hair is&nbsp;entirely normal for most women.</p><p>However, there are medical conditions that can exacerbate facial hair growth. The most prevalent is&nbsp;polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>affects</a> around 8–13% of&nbsp;women. Most of&nbsp;the time, up&nbsp;to&nbsp;70% of&nbsp;these women don’t even know they have&nbsp;it. PCOS, a&nbsp;hormonal disorder, is&nbsp;the leading cause of&nbsp;excessive facial hair growth. Another contributor is&nbsp;idiopathic hyperandrogenemia, wherein women have elevated levels of&nbsp;male hormones like testosterone, accounting for an&nbsp;additional 6-15% of&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Both genders can naturally have facial <a href=#>hair</a>, but societal norms often dictate whether we&nbsp;should remove it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZurdKknJ1lna56uLXFnmStp12nsq671Z5koZ2iYrq2v9OamqGdXZa7pXnHnqlmqpWovbC60p5ksJmjYsKvsdepnJyslZl6eX2XcW9xZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
