But with many Brits left confused by contestants' use of phrases like “salty”, “muggy” and “snakey” to express themselves, new <a href=#>YouGov Omnibus</a> research finds out how many Britons actually understand Love Island lingo.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Buzzin.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Buzzin' - 48% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: a low, vibrating, humming sound, as of bees, machinery, or people talking.</p><p>Love Island definition: being extremely happy or excited. Example: “Liv just asked me to be her boyfriend, I’m absolutely buzzin’”.</p><p>Okay, you might have heard this in your everyday life as half (48%) of Brits know the meaning of this term as used on Love Island. A further 7% interpret it as a busy or lively atmosphere.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/my20type20on20paper.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>My type on paper - 30% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: in theory rather than in reality.</p><p>Love Island definition: someone you fancy. Example: You are 100% my type on paper, so I just think it'd be good for us to get to know each other a bit better.</p><p>Again, this isn’t exclusive to the villa and three in ten (30%) know that it refers to someone whose personality, appearance or physique is exactly the sort of person they'd usually fancy. Another 7% understand the phrase to mean someone you’re attracted to in theory, but not in practice.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Melt.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Melt - 14% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: to become liquefied by warmth or heat, as ice, snow, butter, or metal.</p><p>Love Island definition: <strong>1.</strong> An insult describing a person who has fallen for someone and gone soft. Example: “I can’t believe how much I fancy him, I’m acting like such a melt” <strong>2.</strong> A wimp, a loser. Example: “Jonny is literally a tuna melt.”</p><p>Only 14% of our Brits even came close to getting this one right: 10% believe it means an idiot or a wimp, and 4% think it has something to do with fancying or liking somebody. Seven in ten (70%) simply didn’t know, and another 3% go back to their GCSE physics class and reckon it refers to the process of turning something from a solid state to a liquid.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Salty.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Salty - 13% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: tasting of or containing salt.</p><p>Love Island definition: Someone who’s bitter, easily annoyed, or highly argumentative. As used in the sentence: “Amber’s so salty, she’s screaming at Kem for throwing a pillow at her.”</p><p>Two-thirds (67%) didn’t know what it means, but those who did guess were pretty uniform in assuming that it isn’t a compliment. Just 13% of respondents correctly said that ‘salty’ means being bitter or argumentative, with another 7% believing it describes a bad person.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Grafting.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Grafting - 9% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: <strong>Botany.</strong> To insert (a graft) into a tree or other plant; insert a scion of (one plant) into another plant. <strong>Surgery.</strong> To transplant (a portion of living tissue, as of skin or bone) as a graft.</p><p>Love Island definition: To put a lot of effort into getting to know or flirting with a person. As used in the sentence: “Theo’s really going to have to graft with Tyla after what he said last night.”</p><p>Over half (52%) define "grafting" to describe working hard. However, the Love Island definition is specifically about putting in work to impress or flirt with someone and only 9% used this definition. Four in ten (39%) don’t know.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Muggy.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Muggy - 5% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: (of the atmosphere, weather, etc.) oppressively humid; damp and close.</p><p>Love Island definition: Someone who’s playing you, or taking you for a fool/mug. Example: “Muggy Mike just stole the girl I’m seeing”.</p><p>One in five (22%) Brits think ‘muggy’ could only refer to cloudy and humid weather and a further 5% assume that ‘muggy’ refers to someone hot. But this is Love Island, and that would be far too simple.</p><p>Only 5% correctly defined this term as someone who’s being two-faced or just an unsavoury character in general. As you might imagine, on a show like Love Island, it’s a term that’s used very regularly. Over six in ten (63%) didn’t dare to venture a guess on this one.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Shade.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Shade - 13% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: a place or an area of comparative darkness, as one sheltered from the sun.</p><p>Love Island definition: Saying something disrespectful about somebody, often in a sneaky or backhanded manner. Example: “Chris threw some serious shade at Mike back there”.</p><p>Continuing the weather theme, 11% think ‘shade’ just refers to staying out of the sun. In reality ‘throwing shade’ or ‘being shady’ is all about disrespecting someone. Just 13% of Brits got this one right, while 71% didn’t know.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Pied.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Pied - 12% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: a baked food having a filling of fruit, meat, pudding, etc., prepared in a pastry-lined pan or dish and often topped with a pastry crust.</p><p>Love Island definition: To abruptly or rudely dump somebody, often in favour of somebody else. Example: “Olivia pied off Sam as soon as Chris entered the villa - ouch".</p><p>In the villa, being ‘pied’ means being unceremoniously dumped. Only 12% of Brits got this one right, with a further 14% thinking the word referred to being drunk, while 70% have no clue at all. A few (1%) had high ambitions for contestants' linguistic abilities and assumed that ‘pied’ referred to the French word for foot.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Stick20it20on20em.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Stick it on 'em - 12% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: none.</p><p>Love Island definition: engaging in intimate behaviour with someone. Example: “Jamie stuck it on Camilla last night”.</p><p>This term divides Britain, with 13% thinking that “sticking it on” someone means hitting them and another 7% believing that it means blaming somebody. One in eight (12%) correctly stated that it means making a move on somebody.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Snakey.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>Snakey - 36% understand it</strong></p><p>Dictionary definition: any of numerous limbless, scaly, elongate reptiles of the suborder Serpentes, comprising venomous and non-venomous species inhabiting tropical and temperate areas.</p><p>Love Island definition: Being devious or underhand; manipulating the people around you in order to get your way. Example: “Jonny’s just plain lying to Camilla, he’s being so snakey at the moment”.</p><p>There’s a pretty clear biblical allusion in this one, helping 36% of Brits work out that being ‘snakey’ is all about slyness in order to get what you want.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/The20ick.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>The ick - 3% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: none.</p><p>Love Island definition: the discomfort felt upon contact with a romantic partner you are no longer attracted to. Example: Things were going really well with Sam, but now I've caught the ick, I just don't think I can kiss him.</p><p>While "the ick" is quite common within the Love Island villa, 83% of Brits have no idea what it means, while only 3% correctly define the word.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Cracking20on.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h4><strong>Cracking on - 15% understand it</strong></h4><p>Dictionary definition: To begin moving or working.</p><p>Love Island definition: Making a concerted effort to start a romantic relationship with someone. Example: “I can’t believe that snake Jonny is cracking on with Tyla when he’s just pied off Camilla. What an utter mug".</p><p>This is a very common term for getting a move on with something and 41% of Brits gave this definition. However, in the villa it means something much more specific - to get to work... on someone else. Around one in seven (15%) know it refers to getting to better know a person you are interested in, flirting with them, and, occasionally, to want to spend some alone time with them.</p><p>Photos: ITV</p><p><strong><a href=#>Find out more about YouGov Omnibus</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYW2DdYCMpaavnV2ewK2tzZ1krKSRo7Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
