In the first slide, the one-year-old can be seen smiling while sitting on a gold couch. On top of his head is a cute birthday crown that reads “One” on it, with the “O” replaced by a bear design.</p><p>In other photos, Rome is standing and happily laughing. Meanwhile, in next slides, Rome is pictured having the first taste of his birthday cake. Johnson and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chmerkovskiy</a> then joined their first born for a candid family photo.</p><p>“Happy 1st Birthday to the sweetest soul I’ve ever known,” Johnson wrote in the caption. “I am torn with emotions on this beautiful day of celebration. A full year of knowing you, loving you, and learning from you. Yet how have 365 magical days gone by of you being my tiny (huge) baby that I’ll never get back?”</p><p>The DWTS pro went on and reflected how time truly became “the greatest gift” she’ll cherish. Johnson and Chmerkovskiy welcomed Rome following a devastating marriage in 2021. The next year, the couple announced that they were expecting, calling it their “biggest dream come true yet.”</p><p>“Thank you for making me a mother. It’s been a dream come true to watch you grow into the most observant and joyful boy. I love you with every fiber of my being!” she concluded her tribute post.</p><p>Chmerovskiy The couple, who are currently on Dancing With The Stars Live Tour, celebrated their boy’s special day before they embarked on tour. Johnson and Chmerkovskiy are set to perform for the tour from January 11 to February 4.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-paid-tribute-to-rome-ahead-of-2024>She Paid Tribute to Rome Ahead of 2024</h2><p>Before 2024 kicked off, Johnson reflected on how the year 2023 dramatically changed their family for the better. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro compiled all short clips from when Rome arrived, to the bonding moments they had while their baby is growing up.</p><p>“Thank you for the greatest gift of my life,” she wrote. “Forever grateful for this transformative year as a family of 3 and all the blessings that came with meeting my Rome!”</p><p>Back in December, Johnson gave a glimpse of how they celebrated as a family. On Instagram, the DWTS pro shared photos of Rome’s first time meeting Santa Claus. She also shared their first ever family picture for the holidays. In the pictures, the family went matchy, wearing red-checkered pajamas while smiling.</p><p>Furthermore, earlier in January, Johnson shared how their family alongside Maks Chmerkovskiy’s day family spent an outing at Park City, Utah.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_KelseaBallerini_ChaseStokes_Taylor-HillWireImage-220x147.jpeg alt="Kelsea Ballerini, Chase Stokes Mark First Anniversary: “Thanks For Making Me Write Love Songs”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6lp5ldn7yputKopWaukaF6pLTMnqmkp6aouKrFjJycpZ2Sp661sYyspqdloqS6pr%2BMn6Crq6Rir6q%2B06GbmrFdqMSmsdOeqq1lo6TCrXnIr5xmnaaav263zaiup2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
