He explained why he loves this fresh take on the competition even more than the original AGT.</p><p>“First of all, it’s all the best acts in the history of AGT…everybody who’s won or come close to winning,” Mandel said.</p><p>He went on to highlight how <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantasy League</a> allows judges to mentor fan favorite acts, compete against each other, and avoid having to sit through lengthy auditions. Some of the returning performers Mandel is most excited about include pole dancer Kristy Sellars and Indian dance group V Unbeatable.</p><p>While eager to help guide these acts to victory, Mandel also wants to come out on top over his fellow judges. When asked by Hudson who he sees as his biggest competition, Mandel responded that he wants to beat all of them.</p><p>However, the comedian did proceed to single out Heidi Klum as a particularly formidable opponent. “Heidi is very, very competitive,” Mandel revealed about his longtime co-star. Though the judges are pitted against each other on the show, Mandel insisted there is also plenty of lighthearted camaraderie amongst them behind the scenes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howie-mandel-is-preparing-to-welcome-a-new-grandchild>Howie Mandel is Preparing to Welcome a New Grandchild</h2><p>In a separate interview segment, Mandel also chatted with Hudson about his life as a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grandfather</a>. He revealed his daughter is expecting another child, making Mandel a grandfather for the third time. As always, the comedian found humor in the situation.</p><p>“We’re having one of those reveal parties so you don’t know what it is yet,” Mandel said. “I know it’s a girl, but we’re going to find out who the father is.”</p><p>Mandel shared photos of his two older grandchildren, gushing about how being a grandfather is even better than being a father.</p><p>“Just to have a child to have a baby to have this bundle of joy in this love that I can’t get enough of and then to be able to give it back when it starts to smell is the best part,” he said.</p><p>Judging by Mandel’s obvious joy for his grandkids, he’ll surely be over the moon to welcome another baby into the family soon. When he’s not busy with AGT commitments, spending time with his grandchildren seems to be Mandel’s top priority.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_NiallHoran_Huntley_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Everything There is to Know About ‘The Voice’ Season 24 Winner Huntley" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuop1doq6vsMSlZJykkZ66tHnToaCsZZqqsaixjKKqZqCZqHqjtcagnKysXZi8rrzEraCtoZ%2Bjeqq6jJqerWWWlru1rdKyZKWdkZzCpns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
