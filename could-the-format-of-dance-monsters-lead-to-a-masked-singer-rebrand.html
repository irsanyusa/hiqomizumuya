In 2023, it seems like the beloved show may undergo a rebrand, with the arrival of Netflix’s Dance Monsters. Although the show is completely different than The Masked Singer, it may solve an issue the show has repeatedly had.</strong></p><p>It’s no secret that the costumes on The Masked Singer are big and often hot from the studio lights. The show has featured several celebrity contestants asking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">take their costume off</a> due to how unbearable the heat was. Dance Monsters‘s format may solve that issue.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-the-masked-singer-rebrand-because-of-dance-monsters>Will The Masked Singer Rebrand Because of Dance Monsters?</h2><p>Netflix’s answer to the popular show The Masked Singer takes the show’s fictional and quirky characters and digitally takes it to the next level. Fans of the show are now wondering if The Masked Singer will get a rebrand due to it being similar to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dance Monsters</a>.</p><p>Dance Monsters, which feature contestants competing in a dance competition virtually (think <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alter Ego</a>, with virtual The Masked Singer costumes). This show proves that The Masked Singer‘s format can take place without having to actually place the celebrity in the costume. It’s possible that this could entirely solve the problem of overheating for the competitors.</p><p>Another reason why it would be better to change the setting of The Masked Singer is because of the tedious rules that the celebrities have to follow. One of the show’s rules states that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the celebrities</a> need to be in costume almost all the time while on set. This can be incredibly hard for the individuals behind the costumes as donning a disguise while practicing is difficult.</p><p>In the new Netflix program, amateur dancers disguised as CGI avatars will perform their greatest routines in the hopes of winning $250,000. The production team of The Masked Singer might favor a similar idea of using CGI avatars to hide their celebrity contestants. If that were to happen, they will have to change the show’s title due to the lack of wearing costumes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-new-show-s-semi-finals-saw-duet-challenges>The New Show’s Semi-Finals Saw Duet Challenges</h2><p>In episodes four to six, 12 competitors danced as their unique monster alter-egos. However, at the end of the sixth episode, only six participants remained, including Chester, Beti, Grummy, Flame, Marsha, and Hammer. The contestants completed various challenges and worked hard to establish their value in the competition as the difficulty level increased.</p><p>The duet challenges sees the competitors paired into groups of two where they try to work in sync with each other while also trying to outdo each other. They were informed by the Dance Monsters judges that they would be considering the team as a whole rather than just one candidate.</p><p>The top two pairs would advance directly to the semifinals, leaving the other four competitors to compete as single dancers in the championship round. The two pairs that are down in the bottom would have to say goodbye to the competition.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_Malevo_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Everything You Need to Know About Argentinian Dance Group Malevo, Competing on ‘AGT All Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dance monsters</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqispZxdqbWmecWoqaaZpGK8p3nDmqWcnV2ivK%2B%2F056prGWcmq6ledOoZJplnZbArLHDZqqippeav26%2BxJupmqaUZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
