I don’t think so. Wow.” he tweeted.</p><p>The management of Carnegie Mellon University, where Anya works as a lecturer has also distanced itself from the tweet saying it does not condone the 'offensive and objectionable' message the professor published on her Twitter page.</p><p><strong>Bashir Ahmad,</strong> Special Assistant on Digital Communications to President Muhammadu Buhari has also reacted to the controversy, saying Anya’s tweet was “unfortunately unnecessary.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He tweeted, “Don’t know that Uju Anya until I saw some of her tweets for the first time on my timeline this evening, her tweets about late Queen Elizabeth II were so unfortunately unnecessary.”</p><p>While many condemned Anya’s tweet, there are others who believe she was not wrong.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miuqKqcmXyzscCcq6Knnqh6tb7AoqNmrZqqeqK62JqqZpuforqmutNmmJunpal6pcXIp55mqaWasq95xKWgs5mSmsGpe8OynnCup6Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
