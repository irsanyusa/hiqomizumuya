Health and Safety Executive <a href=#>statistics</a> show that work-related stress, depression or anxiety represented 50% of all work-related illness in 2020-21, with incidences rising significantly over the last 20 years.</p><p>YouGov research shows half of workers in Britain (52%) say they feel “very” or “fairly” stressed at work. A further 36% say they do not feel very stressed, with just 10% saying they don’t feel stressed at all while working.</p><p>Almost four in ten workers (39%) also say they feel stressed when they think about work outside of work hours. Three in 10 (31%) say they feel very or fairly stressed even when they’re not working and not thinking about work.</p><p>Between 53% and 58% of workers in the under-60 age groups say they feel stressed at work, compared to just 34% of workers in the 60+ age group. Workers under 30 are most likely to report feeling stressed when thinking about work outside of work hours (47%) compared to just 23% of workers aged 60 and older.</p><p>And while 35% of workers under 30 say they feel stressed outside of work, compared to 21% of workers in their 60s and older, this difference (14 points) is less stark.</p><h3>How does work life impact life outside of work?</h3><p>Half of workers (50%) say they spend a lot of time, or a fair amount of time, thinking about work outside of working hours, with 47% saying they spend not much or no time at all. Overall, nearly nine in 10 workers (88%) say they think about work outside of working hours.</p><p>Britons with stressful jobs also tend to have work on their mind a lot more than those who feel relaxed at their workplace. Two-thirds of those who say they feel stressed at work (66%) spend a lot or a fair amount of time thinking about their job outside of working hours, compared to a third (34%) of those who say they don’t feel stressed.</p><p>On the question of whether work life has a positive or negative impact (or no impact at all), workers are split. A third (33%) say their work life has a negative impact on their life outside of work, while a further third (34%) say a positive impact and 26% say it has no impact at all.</p><p>Part-time workers (working up to 29 hours a week) are more likely than full-time workers to say their work life has a positive impact on their lives outside of work, by 45% to 30%, while full-timers are more likely than part-timers to say their work negatively impacts their life, by 36% to 23%.</p><h3>Do Britons work too much?</h3><p>More workers in Britain work unpaid overtime (49%) than work paid overtime (42%).</p><p>Three in 10 (29%) say they work unpaid overtime at least once a week, including one in nine (11%) who say they work unpaid overtime every working day. Paid overtime is less frequent – 13% say they work paid overtime at least once a week.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/overtime-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>More than half of workers (56%) say their friends and family have asked them to cut back on how much they work, including one in five (20%) who say this happens very or fairly frequently. Four in 10 workers (41%) say they have never been asked by loved ones to cut back on their hours.</p><p>Workers in ABC1 households are more likely than those in C2DE households to say that their family and friends have asked them to cut back on work, by 61% to 48%.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsY2aEc3nHmqOfZZKntrW10qFksKeioLKzv4ysmLJlpJ2yunnFnpylZaOpv6a%2F0p6bZq%2Bfp7g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
