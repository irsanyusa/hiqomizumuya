Joshua. It has over a million <strong>YouTube </strong>subscribers.&nbsp;</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The morning greeting repeats itself even in the afternoon. When asked why, a member of the church said the phrase is used regardless of the time of the day. “We greet according to the promises of God,” he explains.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>A day inside this popular megachurch&nbsp;</h2></p><p>A member of the Church's media department is on hand to lead visitors further inside. SCOAN is built with stones, wood and stained glass windows. It also has an illuminated fountain behind the altar complemented by portrayals of the last supper.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-20ea882f-e550-44d5-a075-316df68750dc data-caption="Inside SCOAN (Harry Sleijster, Netherlands) "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/122ktkpTURBXy85ZWEyOWZjNzM1OTc1MTc5YmI0YWU4MGQxZWFjYWRmYS5qcGeRlQLNAoDNAeDCww></span><p>The scale of the Church is reminiscent of a blockbuster Hollywood movie set.

The guide showed off a bakery, medical section, a gym, and 10 ambulances in the automobile service area. For guests of the Church, accommodation is sectioned into regular and VIP for <a href=# id=7bac3ab4-f418-4345-b7fe-1f790448b43a>important guests like celebrities</a>, ministers and <a href=# id=85f89306-9f40-4a9f-9004-e18383cf4492>even presidents.&nbsp;</a></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-2d463fd1-4891-4bd4-a9c5-d931caa7b2a2 data-caption="Outside the high end lodge reserved for important visitors (Business Insider SSA)"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/FKektkpTURBXy80M2E4ODBhZWY4ODI2NzNhYzZhYTY0NWQ1YmY3NGU4OS5qcGeRlQLNAwDNAkDCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This section also has an area for children and a zoo with dogs and a couple of exotic birds. Outside of the compound are a couple of tents.

Reportedly, the church attracts more weekly attendees than the combined number of visitors to <strong>Buckingham Palace </strong>and the <strong>Tower of London.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“About two million local and inbound tourists” visit annually,<strong> The Guardian </strong>reported a few years ago.&nbsp;</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e2c6166e-3c12-4b7b-b8f7-be48c1ce83af data-caption="SCOAN is always filled to capacity every Sunday"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/t3QktkqTURBXy80MGNhOTRmZTA0MzE1NGE2NjIzZGJkYmFjZTU3NmI3Yi5qcGVnkZUCzQMWzQGuwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The church provides its own electricity, water and built the road between the two compounds. The guide says the church is responsible for the good roads around the church as it cannot depend on the government.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>The Genesis of SCOAN</h2></p><p>Prophet T.B Joshua’s ministry started over 30 years ago with about seven people in a swampy area. This old site has since been transformed into what is now called the Prayer Mountain. A bus ride is required to get there. This is where you will find the founder’s original place of worship, along with a resort area. This site is very quiet and filled with seats and trees that provide adequate shade for the prayers. The guide says the area is active 24 hours a day. It is surrounded by water which provides a scenic, calming effect.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e8c02f2d-cf26-40a3-b9ab-b134536ba512 data-caption="T.B.

Hotels, restaurants and other establishments around the area also enjoy business from the thousands that flock the church every other week.&nbsp;</p><p>Mrs<strong> Ime Udo</strong>, the Vice President of the<strong> Nigerian Association of Tour Operators (NANTA)</strong> told pressmen that “Religious practices both under the auspices of Christianity, Islam and traditional practices have in no small way contributed to the development of tourism in the world."</p><p>"The local community; hotel operators, food vendors and others around SCOAN must have benefitted from tourists. SCOAN has, no doubt, contributed immensely to the tourism profile of Nigeria with several heads of government from various African countries that had visited there to seek spiritual restoration and advise from Pastor TB Joshua."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-b0e50b81-1876-48d6-9487-c9b946af797e data-caption="T.B Joshua with Liberia's President George Weah"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/3CjktkqTURBXy83ZDZlNGZiMWIzM2MzYjI0YjAxYjJkOTY1ZjQ2ZTMwYi5qcGVnkZUCzQMWzQLJwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Commenting on the relocation rumors, a hotel operator told the press it would have a negative effect on the hospitality business in that area and the state.</p><p>“Ninety–five per cent of guests that lodge in hotels in the community are international and local visitors outside Lagos and they are SCOAN members. We have over 130 rooms and are always fully booked every weekend. We usually enjoy huge patronage from Fridays to Sundays weekly; and they are mostly SCOAN members from near and far,” she explained.&nbsp;The preacher has remained in the country.</p><p>Over the years, TB Joshua has become one of the wealthiest preachers in Africa with an estimated net worth of $10 million — $15 million according to<strong> Forbes.</strong></p><p>Apart from his ministry, <a href=# id=5b0ded6a-796b-4e14-b8d3-5d0e3cce129a>he is well known for giving over $20 million</a> to several causes in education, healthcare and rehabilitation programs for former Niger Delta militants. Since he has no known business, it is safe to assume that this comes from his ministry, which is tax-exempt in Nigeria because of its charity status.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6d85da81-ae3a-4f06-9f7d-635f7be5066c data-caption="T.B.
