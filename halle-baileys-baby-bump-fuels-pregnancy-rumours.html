Though she wore oversized tracks and a grey hoodie, what looked like a bulging baby bump was easy to spot as she walked along the streets of Santa Monica.</p><p>It was also noticed that Bailey had a band-aid on her arm, which led to speculations that she was on her way from a doctor's appointment.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The speculations started in August with the emergence of a video clip of Halle and her older sister,<strong> Chloe</strong>, attending <strong>Beyonce</strong>'s Renaissance concert. In the clip, the <a href=# id=12582d26-ee5a-45d3-9e08-e251eff1eda7><strong>Little Mermaid</strong></a> actress "looked more bloated than usual" despite wearing a loose pink gown. In more pictures from the event, social media users couldn't help but notice her little bump.</p><p>In another particularly convincing clip from DDG's live session, Halle was spotted walking at the side of his home, with a very noticeable bump as well, while doing what social media users called "the pregnant walk/waddle."</p><p>While the actress trended on Twitter at the time, her older sister took to her Instagram to warn everyone to <a href=# id=0f34a9c3-cbe9-4f63-8bf0-0c4e713c696d data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>keep Halle's name out of their mouths</a>. She said, "Y’'ll better keep my sister's name out your mouth, Thank you. Amen, hallelujah. Bout to get me riled the hell up."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>While these speculations remain unconfirmed by the singer, her boyfriend or her family, congratulatory messages continue to flood in for the 23-year-old as she goes about her normal life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGahmZyhsm6uwKKjnrGjYq%2Birthmma6loGKztrHLrGSpqpWcu6K6wrJkq62dpMKzv46dcJtuoqGw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
