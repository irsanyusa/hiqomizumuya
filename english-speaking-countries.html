This is why many of the countries where English is an official language were former British colonies, including Canada, Australia, South Africa and the United States. English is also widely spoken in India and in parts of Africa. Although Hindi is the most widely-spoken language in India today, English remains an official language in the country and is often used in university education, and within the field of politics. Officially, just 12% of Indian people speak English, with many only speaking it as a second language. Nevertheless, the country has an extremely dense population, meaning that this 12% cross-section of society exceeds 100 million people. As a result, India has one of the largest English-speaking populations on the planet. Throughout the 20th century, the United States emerged as a major political superpower, especially in the years after World War II. Its influence, combined with Hollywood films and the journalistic work of the British Broadcasting Corporation, are credited with the continued spread of the language throughout the century.</p><p class=has-text-color>English remains the only official language of the Commonwealth of Nations and is also the recognised official language of several non-sovereign entities, including Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands and Bermuda.</p><p class=has-text-color>By the turn of the new millennium, English was the most widely-spoken and written language that has ever existed.</p><p class=toggle-heading>Thank you!</p><p>We will be in contact soon.</p>Sent<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/english-speaking-countries-mobile-300x200.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/consultation-modal-img-d.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/consultation-modal-img-m.png><p class=toggle-heading>Thanks for subscribing!</p><p>Check your inbox and confirm your email address to receive offers and updates on our Italian courses.</p>Close windowClose Window<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbXNoKadmV6YvK57xKdmnKeeqbKvwI6epaCkmai1br%2FPnpikoZ6ceqS71Kerq6GVqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
