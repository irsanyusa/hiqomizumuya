Hawaii, most of Arizona and some American territories do not change their clocks, according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Transportation</a> (DOT), which oversees Daylight Saving in the U.S.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">When did daylight saving time start in the United States?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Naturally, the tradition is riddled with confusion. Colloquially referred to as “daylight savings time,” the custom only began within the last century. And, even with its recent origins, there’s still plenty to learn about Daylight Saving Time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So why does Daylight Saving Time begin at 2 a.m.? We looked to the experts — and, in fact, there’s a simple reason why.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">When is Daylight Saving Time 2020?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For the U.S., Daylight Saving Time 2020 starts on Sunday, March 8, at 2 a.m. As the mnemonic, “fall back, spring ahead,” says, we turn the clock to an hour later this Sunday for spring Daylight Saving Time. The fall date is Nov. 1, when we will take that hour off again. For fall Daylight Saving Time, we’ll gain an extra hour of sleep. But, for now, technically speaking, we lose an hour.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Why do we have Daylight Saving Time?</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/daylight-saving-time-2-am-william-willett.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite what some believe, it’s not because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">farmers</a> wanted more light in the fields. (Farmers actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opposed the proposition</a> throughout the 20th century.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, along with the promotion of Daylight Saving Time, farmers had nothing to do with 2 a.m. decision. “Like every other fact people think they have about daylight saving, it turns out it is entirely inverted,” Downing says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The measure was first introduced in 1918, to save energy during World War I, following Britain and Germany. A British architect named William Willett had been the one to truly popularize and promote the custom, according to Downing, though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Benjamin Franklin</a> had come up with a similar idea in loose terms in the 18th century.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Still, it was repealed the following year, thanks to the “vociferous” complaints of the farm lobby, Downing says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite reintroductions during World War II for the same energy-conservation purposes, it didn’t become law until 1966, when Congress passed the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniform Time Act</a>, which also established standard time zones across the U.S. The most prominent lobbyist group for Daylight Saving Time was actually the Chamber of Commerce, Downing says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Why would the Chamber of Commerce care about the clocks? They lobbied, for the most part, on behalf of the department stores who were really the “economic force” in metropolitan areas, specifically in big cities like New York, Downing says. “They had understood that if you gave workers more daylight at the end of the day when they were leaving work, they would stop and shop on the way home,” he explains. “It has turned out to be an incredible retail boom.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Beyond the retail boom, this also gave New York and London an extra working hour when they could trade stocks. Between the stocks and the department stores, Downing says New York City fell in love with Daylight Saving Time, and even passed its own metropolitan form of the law in 1920.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Naturally, before the country adopted the policy legislatively, there was a great deal of confusion. Considering this was pre-internet, people really had a hard time keeping track of what time it would be where. “It just made everyone nuts,” Downing says. “I mean, the confusion was really profound.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the U.S. still follows the same Uniform Time Act passed in 1965, under the notion that this changing of the clocks conserves energy for the nation. Though 21st century <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> has shown that this may not be the case, the DOT’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> says Daylight Saving Time saves energy because “the need to use electricity for household lighting and appliances is reduced.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Why does Daylight Saving Time start at 2 a.m.?</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/us-standard-time-zones-daylight-saving-time.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The reason Daylight Saving Time starts at 2 a.m., rather than midnight, is all thanks to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">railroads</a>: Amtrak, specifically. When the country first experimented with Daylight Saving Time in 1918 during World War I, there were actually no trains that left New York City at 2 a.m. on a Sunday. “Sunday morning at 2 a.m. was when they would interrupt the least amount of train travel around the country,” Downing says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There were even fewer freight trains in the early 20th century than there are today, so it made the most sense — changing the clocks at 2 a.m. would not be disruptive. “And that was the sole reason we do it at that crazy time,” Downing explains.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The railroad industry had already played an important role in timekeeping in the U.S., as North American railroads collectively adopted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Standard Railway Time in 1883</a>, operating and dealing with time independently of Congress.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Regardless of your opinion on Daylight Saving Time’s importance in the modern day, we’ll keep the clocks forward until Daylight Saving Time ends on Sunday, Nov. 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWRrgXF%2Fjp2YsqSZnLW1edKaraKml6h6tMDAq6tmrJmisnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
