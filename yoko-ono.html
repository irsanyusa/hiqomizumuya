 Biography: The second wife of John Lennon, from 1969 until his death, was initially criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music, and blamed for the breakup of the Beatles. Public opinion of her shifted over time, thanks in large part to her significant philanthropic contributions and her role in peace and feminist movements.
Ono was involved in conceptual and avant garde visual and performance art in NYC in the early 1960s."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While visiting England, she first solicited <a href=#>Paul McCartney</a> for a contribution to a salute to composer <a href=#>John Cage</a>, and later met John Lennon at a gallery show of her visual art.</p><p>She and Lennon became a couple, leading to his divorce from his wife Cynthia. As the Beatles broke up, Lennon began performing and recording with Ono, who provided lyric ideas and wailing vocals. Ono continued making art, adding film to her portfolio. After a separation at her insistence, from mid-1973 until 1975 (known as Lennon's "Last Weekend"), they had a son, Sean. John stepped away from music and became a house-husband while Yoko tended to the couple's business.</p><p>In 1980, they went to a recording studio in NYC to studio to make an album with individual songs, hers being more accessible than some earlier endeavors. The result was the "Double Fantasy" album. He was killed shortly after the album's release.</p><p>Since his death, Ono has continued cultivating Lennon's legacy. She also continues as an activist for peace, women's rights, and environmental causes.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>February 18</a>, <a href=#>1933</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Tokyo, Japan<br><b>Age: <a href=#>91 years old</a></b></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Silent Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Rooster</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aquarius</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Career Highlights</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1966-11-07</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> meets Yoko Ono at an avante-garde art exposition at Indica Gallery in London</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1967-10-11</a> "Yoko Plus Me" art exhibition by Yoko Ono opens in London (the "Me" is <a href=#>John Lennon</a>)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1968-06-15</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono plant two acorns for peace, at Coventry Cathedral, Conventry, England</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1968-08-31</a> Private Eye magazine reports a <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono album will have a picture of them nude on the cover</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1968-10-18</a> Police find 219 grains of cannabis resin in <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono's apartment, they are fined Â£150 for marijuana possession</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1968-10-25</a> Yoko Ono announces she is having <a href=#>John Lennon</a>'s baby; she later suffers a miscarriage</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1968-11-29</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono release their 1st album "Two Virgins" in UK</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1968-12-12</a> Rolling Stones film TV show "Rock and Roll Circus"- guest performers include The Who, Jethro Tull, Taj Mahal, Marianne Faithfull, and <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono; the program never airs aired</li><li></li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-01-03</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono's "Two Virgins" album declared pornographic in New Jersey</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-03-25</a> Beatle <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and new wife Yoko Ono stage their 1st bed-in for peace, at the Hilton Hotel in Amsterdam, Netherlands</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-05-26</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono begin their 2nd bed-in for peace at Hotel La Reine Elizabeth, Montreal, Quebec, Canada</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-05-31</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono record "Give Peace a Chance" in a Montreal hotel, during their second 'bed-in' for peace; other performers include Tommy Smothers, Petula Clark, Timothy Leary, and Dick Gregory</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-06-04</a> Beatles release "The Ballad Of John & Yoko" (recorded by just John and Paul), backed with <a href=#>George Harrison</a>'s song, "Old Brown Shoe" in the US</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-06-11</a> "The Ballad Of John & Yoko" by The Beatles hits #1 in UK; recording <a href=#>involved only John</a> (guitars, vocals, percussion) and Paul (bass, drums, piano, backing voice)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-06-14</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono appear on <a href=#>David Frost</a>'s British TV Show</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-07-01</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono are admitted to hospital after he crashes his car near Durness in the Scottish Highlands</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-08-22</a> The Beatles last official group photo session, at John & Yoko's home 'Tittenhurst Park', near Ascot</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-09-13</a> Plastic Ono Band's 1st live performance, featuring <a href=#>John Lennon</a>, Yoko Ono and <a href=#>Eric Clapton</a>, at the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-11-07</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono release their second album "Wedding Album" in UK</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-12-15</a> <a href=#>John Lennon</a> and Yoko Ono's Plastic Ono Band, play their only European gig - appearing in UNICEF charity concert at London's Lyceum Ballroom, band is augmented by Bonnie & Delaney Bramlett, guitarists <a href=#>George Harrison</a> and <a href=#>Eric Clapton</a>, and keyboardist <a href=#>Billy Preston</a></li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1969-12-16</a> "War is Over!
