Apparently, one follower mistook the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro’s current partner Elena Belle as his “wife,” asking how he and Elena Belle (whose real name is Natacha Peyre Requena) keep things spicy in their relationship. Subsequently, this has prompted an intriguing answer from Savchenko.</p><p>“I might’ve missed a wedding lol,” he answered. “Not a wife yet… But who knows, let’s see what the future holds.”</p><p>After clarifying the fan’s assumption, he then proceeded to answer the original question. According to the professional dancer, he’s lucky for having an understanding partner.</p><p>“It’s all about trust and respect to each other. I have the best supportive girlfriend who understands my type of work. We are very much in love,” he wrote.</p><p>Earlier this year, fans speculated that Savchenko and Elena Belle had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">broken up</a>. Seemingly, the two unfollowed each other on Instagram, with Elena Belle archiving most of Savchenko’s photos on her Instagram feed. The couple did not officially announce their breakup, but they discreetly got back to usual, engaging with one another on Instagram stories.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Remains Intact with His Two Daughters</h2><p>In November 2020, Savchenko and his first wife, Elena Samodanova broke to the public that they have decided to split up. Their divorce was finalized in 2021, with Savchenko promising that he will remain a father to their daughters.</p><p>“My No. 1 priority right now [is] and always will be my daughters and making this divorce have as minimal an effect on them as possible. Sometimes relationships don’t work out and this is one of those times,” he said.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> pro, he and Samodanova agreed to “end the marriage with grace.” He further stated that they promised to commit to protect Olivia and Zlata from their differences.</p><p>In March 2022, Samodanova sought primary physical custody over her daughters because of Savchenko’s busy schedule. However, they appeared to have arrived at an arrangement of some type, as Savchenko can still be seen bonding with his daughters.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_DemiLovato_Jerod-HarrisGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Demi Lovato Advocates for Reproductive Justice in New Single ‘Swine’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Gleb Savchenko</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xus8uemWarkauwqbHNpKZmnailuaK1zaxkoaenYrWmecqenKmrXZ22tHnLqK2eZZyes6Z5y6KtnqSpYq6utcNmma6rqWLApLTEnaylnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
