They were not able to&nbsp;go&nbsp;into their house and didn’t have a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;sleep. After this tragic event, Johnson was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sent</a> on&nbsp;an&nbsp;airplane to&nbsp;Nashville, Tennessee so&nbsp;he&nbsp;could live with his dad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b9/585/10d2fb50759e34f98dca84cd4c.jpg><p>When Johnson arrived in&nbsp;Tennessee, he&nbsp;soon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realized</a> that he&nbsp;wasn’t going to&nbsp;live with his dad. He&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;live with a&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;his dad’s, whom he&nbsp;didn’t know, named Bruno. “Bruno could’ve and should’ve said&nbsp;no, I’m not takin’ in&nbsp;some kid who&nbsp;I don’t know. But he&nbsp;didn’t,” the actor recalled.</p><p>“Downtown Bruno,” as&nbsp;the actor calls him, even gave the teen his last $40 bucks so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;could buy his first car. And that’s how the long-lasting <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> started.</p><p><h2>Johnson started his career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional wrestler just like his dad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a6d/1f7/9eeb6a5094b5a46aca7acfbca0.jpg><p>His father, Rocky Johnson, was a&nbsp;well-known wrestler, but Johnson’s aspirations and goals were to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;professional <a href=# title=Football data-link=tag>Football</a> player. “My&nbsp;life has been full of&nbsp;the wildest twists and turns,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> the actor on&nbsp;his social media. Due to&nbsp;an&nbsp;injury, Johnson <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> slowed down from playing the sport and he&nbsp;got un-drafted from the NFL.</p><p>Without a&nbsp;professional football career, Johnson didn’t have many options to&nbsp;earn money, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> his dad to&nbsp;train him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;wrestler. When he&nbsp;was ready, he&nbsp;joined the World Wrestling Federation, and after many years of&nbsp;wrestling, his famous nickname, “The Rock,” was created.</p><p>The Rock was a&nbsp;sensation in&nbsp;the WWF, and lifting his right eyebrow in&nbsp;a&nbsp;menacing way became his signature move.</p><p><h2>His first time on&nbsp;the big screen was in&nbsp;an&nbsp;iconic movie.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3da/2c2/8b834a59648ce9c1bc9bb75923.jpg><p>Dwayne Johnson’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> taste of&nbsp;Hollywood fame came when he&nbsp;was cast in&nbsp;a&nbsp;blockbuster movie called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Mummy Returns</i></a>. After that, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;films like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Scorpion King</i></a><i> </i>and was part of&nbsp;the franchise,<i> Fast &&nbsp;Furious.</i></p><p>In&nbsp;recent years, the actor has reached levels of&nbsp;stardom that he&nbsp;probably didn’t see coming. He&nbsp;has become the next big action star Hollywood was looking for. These days, the actor and his mom don’t have to&nbsp;worry about money at&nbsp;all, probably for the rest of&nbsp;their lives.</p><p><h2>Now that he&nbsp;found success, he&nbsp;gets to&nbsp;thank everyone who helped him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/057/36f/8b9ba15fff99e6752603c9f2e0.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/205/21d/7864ca5681a3fe6a5f68ea48f5.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the famous actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a> on&nbsp;Instagram, Bruno was one of&nbsp;the people that helped him “change the trajectory of&nbsp;the road&nbsp;I was going down.” Downtown Bruno gave teen Johnson a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;change his future.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;very emotional video that The Rock posted on&nbsp;his social media, he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;give Bruno a&nbsp;big surprise by&nbsp;gifting him a&nbsp;brand new truck. “Since you helped me&nbsp;buy my&nbsp;first car&nbsp;— I&nbsp;figured&nbsp;I could return the favor,” said the actor. Johnson even added a&nbsp;very nice promise at&nbsp;the end, saying, “When you’re ready to&nbsp;retire from the business, you just say the word. I&nbsp;got you covered.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/877/4d1/fdbb2057e082ed982822c160e4.png><p>Have you ever received a&nbsp;nice present that you remember fondly?
