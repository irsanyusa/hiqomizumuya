In&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, she revealed that she once considered <a href=# title="plastic surgery" data-link=tag>plastic surgery</a> but thinks it’s too late now, as&nbsp;she is&nbsp;“too old.” The actress explained, “I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;some process where it&nbsp;could all be&nbsp;sucked out, and&nbsp;I could be&nbsp;out of&nbsp;there in&nbsp;time for dinner, but I’m frightened it&nbsp;would all drop off under the anesthetic.”</p><p><h2>Her first acting role was portraying a&nbsp;snail.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/934/6ac/0085515aac84a7be1e841f49e2.jpg><p>Mary Evans/AF Archive/East News</p><p>At&nbsp;age 5, Dench was cast to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;snail in&nbsp;a&nbsp;school <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>play</a>. All she had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was crawl across the stage under an&nbsp;enormous shell her father had made for her. Even though it&nbsp;was simple, she actually didn’t manage to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;right. When her parents came to&nbsp;the stage, she stood up&nbsp;and revealed herself under the costume, which made the audience remind her to&nbsp;continue crawling.</p><p><h2>Dench’s success came later in&nbsp;life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/79b/511/57bb995b91920e306d5971eeb1.jpg><p>MCI/EAST NEWS</p><p>When Dench was in&nbsp;her early fifties, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, she was asked why she didn’t act in&nbsp;many films, and she revealed that it&nbsp;was because she wasn’t asked to&nbsp;do&nbsp;many because “it’s not what they want to&nbsp;look&nbsp;at.” She explained further, “Sometimes, about films, if&nbsp;you don’t go&nbsp;in&nbsp;looking like the person you are meant to&nbsp;look like in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>film</a>, people don’t cast you in&nbsp;that part. Whereas in&nbsp;the theater, you can fill a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;the time.”</p><p>Later, she got many more movie roles and received all 7&nbsp;of&nbsp;her Academy Award <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominations</a> after the age of&nbsp;60.</p><p><h2>She regrets not having more children.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Dench revealed that she wanted to&nbsp;have at&nbsp;least 6&nbsp;children, but that didn’t happen for her. “I&nbsp;wanted a&nbsp;house full of&nbsp;them. I&nbsp;would have loved to&nbsp;have had that. But it&nbsp;didn’t happen. I&nbsp;didn’t get married until&nbsp;I was&nbsp;36, so&nbsp;I left it&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit late,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p>She and her husband also considered adopting, but the adoption agencies didn’t let them because they were over 40. However, Dench is&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;have her daughter, Finty, and her grandson, Sam.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know other lesser-known facts about Judi Dench?</p><p>Preview photo credit Vianney Le Caer/Invision/East News<span>, </span>AP/EAST NEWS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLe2sMhmm56mk516pLHLnpmrmaSawG60xKtkcXCknXqjtdGtn52ZqWKur7CMoZyrnV2Wv6Z5lGadmpukqHq4sYydoJ2mpGK4r7vWZpibp6Wpeqmx0WZvamhjZ4Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
