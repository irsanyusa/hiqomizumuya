He also sang in his high school’s chorus. When he was younger, he and his sister would sing with their parents in the car. His favorite artists included James Taylor and Boyz II Men.</p><p>The singer attended college in Nashville, where he joined an a cappella group and started songwriting. He then returned to Massachusetts before moving to New York and eventually Los Angeles. However, he still has strong ties to his home state and is proud to represent it on American Song Contest.</p><p>“So much of the area I just love,” <a href=#>Jared said</a> in an interview. “It’s an amazing place to grow up because there’s such diversity in what you can do. I can’t say enough good things about Mass. and New England.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jared-has-worked-with-a-number-of-famous-names>Jared Has Worked with a Number of Famous Names</h3><p>Jared has worked as a songwriter and producer for artists such as Jordin Sparks, Jason Derulo, and fellow American Song Contest star Michael Bolton, who’s representing Connecticut. He’s also collaborated with a number of DJs as either a songwriter or a featured vocalist.</p><p>The musician’s songs have even been featured <a href=#>on television</a>, including two tracks on American Idol. He went on to write, produce, and sing the theme song “Don’t Wish Your Life Away” for the 2020 film Fantasy Island.</p><p>“It’s an incredible feeling and I’m hoping for more of it,” Jared said in <a href=#>an interview</a> about his songs being on TV.&nbsp;“It makes you feel proud and in, I guess, a superficial way a bit validated.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-also-released-his-own-music>He’s Also Released His Own Music</h3><p>In addition to writing and producing for other artists, Jared has also released original music of his own that’s available to stream right now. His first EP, Falling Through Holes, debuted in 2011.</p><p>He’s since released several singles, including “Professional Lovers” in 2018 and, more recently, “Afterglow” and “Breathe In Bleed Out.” Jared told <a href=#>ESC United</a> that he wrote a lot of the song “Shameless” with co-writers before American Song Contest, but ended up changing some of it.</p><p>“There is a vulnerability and fearlessness lyrically in the song that I feel ties in really well with the people and attitude of Massachusetts,” <a href=#>Jared said</a>. “So much of who I am as an artist has been influenced by my upbringing and my experiences in Mass so I’m very excited for people to hear it!”</p><p>Be sure to tune in to the American Song Contest Semifinals to see if Jared makes it even further with his song.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NUP_197277_00245.jpg alt="Meet The Youngest ‘American Song Contest’ Semifinalist Ada LeAnn" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Song Contest</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Jared Lee</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWalr%2BmsIylnJ5lopq9s7HSnqWtoZ6ceq6t0qyYnKClqLK1wNJmpqdlkaKys7XCmqVmq5%2BjtG6vzqernqukZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
