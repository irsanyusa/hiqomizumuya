This list will show you that truth is&nbsp;stranger than fiction, and some of&nbsp;the weirdest and wonderful characters of&nbsp;all time actually existed in&nbsp;real life.</p><p><h2>1. Harley Quinn, DC&nbsp;Comics&nbsp;— Arleen Sorkin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6b5/8f2/9998ab5b5f816b7c1c86a229f8.jpg><p><a href=#>Arleen Sorkin</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;American actress, screenwriter, and comedian. Sorkin is&nbsp;known for inspiring and doing the voice for the DC&nbsp;Comics villain Harley Quinn.</p><p>Paul Dini, the creator of&nbsp;the character, shares his <a href=#>memories</a>: “Arleen and&nbsp;I are friends. When I&nbsp;was thinking about Harley, I&nbsp;just thought to&nbsp;myself, “Gosh, she sounds like Arleen.” When Sorkin appeared as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>wacky jester</a> on&nbsp;Days of&nbsp;Our Lives in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Pied Piper outfit, and&nbsp;I was like, “Well, there she&nbsp;is. She should run around with the Joker dressed like that.”</p><p><h2>2. Joker, DC&nbsp;Comics&nbsp;— Conrad Veidt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/833/39d/2ef0f65683bcfe7f779d22cd80.jpg><p>The origin of&nbsp;this creepy clown doesn’t come from the circus. The visual inspiration for Joker was German actor <a href=#>Conrad Veidt</a> with his title role as&nbsp;Gwynplaine in&nbsp;the film <a href=#>The Man Who Laughs</a>.<br>Though the Joker has evolved in&nbsp;the nearly 80&nbsp;years since his debut, the main features of&nbsp;the character have stayed put: his frozen smile as&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;a&nbsp;disfiguring scar and his chalky-white skin brought to&nbsp;the screen back in&nbsp;1928 by&nbsp;Veidt.</p><p><h2>3. Pocahontas, Pocahontas&nbsp;— Irene Bedard</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/62c/036/ace1765c64a252b42bb000e359.jpg><p><a href=#>Irene Bedard</a> is&nbsp;best known for her portrayal of&nbsp;Native American characters in&nbsp;a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;films. For <a href=# title=Disney data-link=tag>Disney</a>, she dubbed and was a&nbsp;physical model for Pocahontas. Irene gave the character a&nbsp;powerful and emotional presence.</p><p><h2>4. Belle, Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;— Vivien Leigh</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/969/2bb/d70c2157468b6bced6ed848025.jpg><p><a href=#>Belle</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;intelligent and beautiful character whose main features were inspired by&nbsp;many famous women and characters. <a href=#>Jo&nbsp;March</a>, the character of&nbsp;actress <a href=#>Katharine Hepburn</a>, gave Belle her strength and love for books. Belle’s elegance is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;impressionist <a href=#>Edgar Degas</a>’ ballerinas and her European facial features were taken from actresses <a href=#>Vivien Leigh</a> and <a href=#>Audrey Hepburn</a>.</p><p><h2>5. Milhouse, The Simpsons&nbsp;— Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fe/61b/bc51045a0cbd9006023c771545.jpg><p><a href=#>Milhouse Van Houten</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;caricature of&nbsp;Paul Pfeiffer (a&nbsp;character in&nbsp;the series The Wonder Years played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Josh Saviano</a>). Both are the best friends of&nbsp;their show’s main characters, have the same hairstyle, prominent noses, and glasses. The characters serve the same character purpose&nbsp;— to&nbsp;stand by&nbsp;their best friends’ respective sides through thick and thin.</p><p><h2>6. Chuckie Finster, Rugrats&nbsp;— Mark Mothersbaugh</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7bd/c63/987834538bb6e40eeef2b97db5.jpg><p><a href=#>Mark Mothersbaugh</a> is&nbsp;an&nbsp;American singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, author, and visual artist. Not only did he&nbsp;create Rugrats’ memorable soundtracks, but also inspired the design of&nbsp;<a href=#>Chucky</a>, one of&nbsp;the show’s main characters.</p><p><h2>7. Kyle Broflovski, South Park&nbsp;— Matt Stone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70f/40a/c47051519d8d42f93cd1296cb1.jpg><p><a href=#>Kyle</a> is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the series co-creator <a href=#>Matt Stone</a>, who voices him, and many of&nbsp;Kyle’s features are inspired by&nbsp;Matt and his feelings, behaviors, and beliefs. His hair is&nbsp;a&nbsp;nod to&nbsp;Matt’s old hairstyle, and both the character and the creator are Jewish.</p><p><h2>8. Severus Snape, Harry Potter&nbsp;— John Nettleship</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91a/83b/7d6ce85bd2abfe234fa1a4f8b6.jpg><p><a href=#>John Nettleship</a> was a&nbsp;chemistry professor and one of&nbsp;his students was J.K. Rowling. It&nbsp;was exactly him who inspired the character of&nbsp;professor Snape in&nbsp;Rowling’s books. First, the physical <a href=#>resemblance</a>: whip-thin and “ghostly white,” with long and often rather greasy black hair, a&nbsp;burning gaze, an&nbsp;intense manner, irregular teeth, and a&nbsp;rather large nose, and he&nbsp;was often a&nbsp;bit scruffy and unkempt. Second, his intelligence, wit, and passion for his subject.</p><p>Everybody that knew him, except himself, recognized him as&nbsp;Snape immediately. John Nettleship even told a&nbsp;<a href=#>story</a>: “Quite a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;my&nbsp;ex-students recognize the inspiration when they see the film. They come to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and say, ’We saw you in&nbsp;the movie, sir’.”</p><p><h2>9. Rocko, Rocko’s Modern Life&nbsp;— Woody Allen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/191/5a8/e38c60574b8839c0dd3a99bf34.jpg><p><a href=#>Rocko</a> has the personality of&nbsp;a&nbsp;young wallaby <a href=#>Woody Allen</a>. <a href=#>Joe Murray</a>, the creator of&nbsp;Rocko’s Modern Life, described his character as&nbsp;a&nbsp;20-year-old male scrub wallaby, who was “a&nbsp;young, anthropomorphic Woody Allen who had just moved away from home into a&nbsp;surrealistic adult world.” In&nbsp;this sketch, he&nbsp;described the character as&nbsp;somewhat spacy and “naive to&nbsp;the new chores of&nbsp;life.”</p><p><h2>10. Krusty the Klown, The Simpsons&nbsp;— Rusty Nails</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a5/586/b2ba8e54dcb5e305931fde58df.jpg><p>Before the world-famous <a href=#>Krusty</a> there was Rusty. His real name is&nbsp;<a href=#>James Allen</a> and he&nbsp;hosted children’s shows in&nbsp;the Portland area. <a href=#>Matt Groening</a>, who grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;Portland, used his childhood memory of&nbsp;Rusty as&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiration for The Simpsons. Unlike Krusty, Rusty was loved by&nbsp;his community and not just by&nbsp;his&nbsp;TV audience.</p><p>Matt wrote in&nbsp;his book <a href=#>Planet Simpson</a>: “Rusty Nails was very nice...a very sweet clown, but he&nbsp;had that name, Rusty Nails, which&nbsp;I found incredibly disturbing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child.”</p><p><h2>11. Alice, Alice in&nbsp;Wonderland&nbsp;— Alice Liddell</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/077/b09/14242a5ab8b9448c4ad1768539.jpg><p>Alice in&nbsp;Wonderland is&nbsp;among the most influential books ever written.<a href=#> Lewis Carroll</a>’s inspiration for this book was <a href=#>Alice Liddell</a>, a&nbsp;10-year-old girl and a&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;his. Lewis found his inspiration in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rowboat in&nbsp;Oxford, England in&nbsp;1858. He&nbsp;was there with the 3&nbsp;young daughters of&nbsp;his close friends Alice, Edith, and Lorina Liddell. To&nbsp;amuse the kids, he&nbsp;created a&nbsp;little story about a&nbsp;girl. Alice found the fairy tale so&nbsp;interesting that she begged Carrol to&nbsp;write it&nbsp;down for her and he&nbsp;couldn’t resist.</p><p><h2>12. Zorro, The Mask of&nbsp;Zorro&nbsp;— Joaquín Murrieta</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eeb/13e/ea40df50039e746113c16216ea.jpg><p>Zorro’s story is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the biography of&nbsp;<a href=#>Joaquín Murrieta</a>. This name was used in&nbsp;the movies with Antonio Banderas, whose character’s surname is&nbsp;Murrieta.</p><p>Joaquin Murrieta was born around 1829 in&nbsp;Hermosillo, Mexico. Murrieta faced racism from white Americans which caused him to&nbsp;rebel against society and its rules. <a href=#>Murrieta</a> had become “a&nbsp;folk hero... a&nbsp;dashing, romantic figure that swore to&nbsp;avenge the atrocities committed upon his family and who committed his many crimes only to&nbsp;‘right’ the many injustices against the Mexicans.”</p><p><h2>13. Winnie-the-Pooh, The Many Adventures of&nbsp;Winnie the Pooh&nbsp;— Winnipeg The Bear</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/494/f21/b46a9c57429bd92c1a12c3d8b5.jpg><p><a href=#>Winnie-the-Pooh</a> is&nbsp;actually inspired by&nbsp;a&nbsp;real-life bear who lived in&nbsp;the London Zoo whose name was <a href=#>Winnipeg</a>. The bear got into the zoo thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Canadian soldier and veterinarian named Harry Colebourn. Winnie was one of&nbsp;the most popular animals in&nbsp;the London Zoo. Christopher Robin was a&nbsp;frequent visitor there, and he&nbsp;even named his teddy bear after Winnie. Inspired by&nbsp;his son’s toy, A.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Milne wrote a&nbsp;story and published Winnie-the-Pooh on&nbsp;October&nbsp;14, 1926.</p><p><h2>14. Vultures, The Jungle Book&nbsp;— The Beatles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b08/831/52ccab5be8b6f615e9c243b8fc.jpg><p>1967 was the height of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Beatles</a> popularity and also the year that <a href=#>The Jungle Book</a> was released by&nbsp;Disney. Supposedly it&nbsp;was the Beatles manager who suggested that Disney Studios design the vultures based on&nbsp;them. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr were about to&nbsp;not only voice the characters but also to&nbsp;sing a&nbsp;song called “That’s What Friends Are For,” when Lennon suddenly refused. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the song was rewritten as&nbsp;a&nbsp;barbershop quartet instead.</p><p><h2>15. Captain Hook, Peter Pan&nbsp;— Hans Conried</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe4/15a/e2a8ca55b4a5cc2990fe0abdc2.jpg><p><a href=#>Captain James Hook’s</a> appearance, from Disney’s version of&nbsp;Peter Pan, was inspired by&nbsp;the American actor, voice actor, and comedian<a href=#> Hans Conried</a>. At&nbsp;first, Hans’ task was only to&nbsp;voice the Captain, but the actor was so&nbsp;vibrant and authentic in&nbsp;costume that the animators decided to&nbsp;use his image as&nbsp;an&nbsp;influence for the character.</p><p>Who is&nbsp;your favorite fictional character?
