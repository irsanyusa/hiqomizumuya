Of course we would have had all kinds of people up there by the time I was old enough to do anything! Growing up, I always assumed I would go to space. I wanted to do lots of things. Be a scientist, a dancer, a policymaker. I would make a difference in what happens in the world, and I knew that I could.</p><p class=p2>People might ask how I felt that way, since in the ’60s one didn’t frequently see images of women and people of color involved in science and technology. And yet I knew, because I had done a great job picking my parents. We talked about strong women. They made sure my siblings and I knew about the remarkable contributions that African Americans had made to this world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2-mae-jemison-time-firsts-endeavour-nasa.jpg><p class=p2>Being first gives you a responsibility—you have a public platform, and you must choose how to use it. I use mine to help folks become more comfortable with the idea that science is integral to our world. And I vowed that I would talk about my work and ask other women about theirs—the nitty-gritty details. People say you can have everything. No, you can’t. But you can have a lot more—and do a lot more—than you think.</p><p class=p4><i>Jemison, who holds degrees in engineering and medicine, went to space on the </i>Endeavour<i> in 1992.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacp5yhsqTAyKilaJ6Zp8C1v45tb3FrYm6AcLnAnmSjnZ2ewLC6jJ%2Bgq6ukqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
