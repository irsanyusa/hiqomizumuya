Tuca is a carefree and recently sober toucan, while songbird Bertie is her career-minded, anxious best friend. Helmed by Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong, the show was funny and relatable, and its cancellation spurred fans to start a <a href=# id=5ea314f3-3308-3a93-a5dd-ef21c8bce5fd>petition</a> that currently sits at over 30,000 signatures.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>Disenchantment</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>What do you get when you mix a rebellious, hard-drinking princess with an optimistic elf companion and a destructive personal demon? Say hello to Disenchantment, the hilarious fantasy series is the brainchild of Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons and Futurama. There are 20 episodes of the show available on Netflix right now, and season two will be released sometime this year.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>F Is for Family</h3></p><p>Ahh, the 1970s. A decade full of questionable fashion choices, questionable facial hair, and questionable parenting. <a href=# id=590bd266-5648-30f0-ab2d-2bebbb758c5f>F Is For Family</a> follows a family in the early '70s that includes "a father trying to provide for his family with a job he hates, a mother trying to be the wife and parent that society demands her to be, and a teen full of angst with a love for rock-n-roll."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>Big Mouth</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You've probably heard about this middle school riot fest by now, but if not, here's a refresher. The series follows a group of seventh graders as they go through puberty, and topics include blooming sexual desires and masturbation. There's also a Hormone Monstress ( <a href=# id=263d34f6-9d58-3b22-a45d-9443e114128b>bubble bath</a> , anyone?), a pillow that can get pregnant, and the ghost of jazz musician Duke Ellington. Happy watching.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>Paradise PD</h3></p><p>Paradise PD's synopsis immediately lets you know what kind of show it is. As <a href=# id=3514156f-79df-3b77-a5a8-ad03d7651cd8>Deadline</a> reports, the show is about "bad cops. Not bad like no nonsense. Not bad like cool. Bad like shitty." Characters on the show include a police chief who got both of his testicles shot off by his son and a police dog who is addicted to the confiscated drugs that he guards.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>Neo Yokio</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Neo Yokio was written and produced by Vampire Weekend's Ezra Keonig, and the anime-inspired series follows Kaz Kaan, a wealthy young man who's also a demon slayer on the side. The super talented cast includes Jaden Smith, Jude Law, Tavi Gevinson, Desus & Mero, and Jason Schwartzman. There's only been one season of the show and a Christmas special, but it's <a href=# id=8c0f3a45-6429-327b-af1f-18aae2e19322>unclear if the show was definitively cancelled</a> .</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>Super Drags</h3></p><p>While Netflix is great, they also have a tendency to cancel great seasons after one season. Super Drags' first and only season consists of just five episodes, but the show is fun and entertaining. The series is actually a Brazilian import, and the dubbed English version features the voices of popular drag queens Shangela, Ginger Minj, Willam Belli, and Trixie Mattel.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>Trailer Park Boys</h3></p><p>Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series is a spin-off of the live-action show Trailer Park Boys, and the mockumentary series follows a group of trailer park residents. The first season was released early last year, so we could get a new one soon.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>We Bare Bears</h3></p><p>This series is a Cartoon Network original, and while it's definitely not as edgy as Bojack Horseman, it still offers funny looks into more adult subjects like anger management and the effects of social media.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>Bojack Horseman Christmas Special</h3></p><p>While this is a bit of a cop out, hear me out first. The 2014 Christmas special mostly consists of Todd and Bojack watching an episode of Bojack's old show Horsin' Around, so technically it's not like you're watching Bojack Horseman itself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cMDHnmSbnaOpeqK6yKaYrZ2UYsCmvsieqmasn2LEosDCoWSanqSav26uzqOYnKNdnbyzv8SmmKdnYZzDqIPSnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
