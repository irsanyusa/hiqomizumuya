She received an outpouring of compliments, including from celebrities like Khloé Kardashian and Meagan Good. However, one commenter accused her of having plastic surgery, writing “Wow, you have a great surgeon.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bailon</a> cleverly replied that her “surgeon” is @nyricanmama – the Instagram handle of her mother, Nilda Felix. Fans loved Adrienne’s comical response and supported her against the plastic surgery accusations.</p><p>One fan wrote that Bailon’s beauty is “homegrown,” while another called the critical commenter “insecure” and said they’ll never have a woman like Bailon. Other fans agreed she got her looks from her mom and praised her “greatest clap back.”</p><p>In a surprise twist, the critical commenter returned to apologize for the plastic surgery speculation. Hopefully it makes them think twice before commenting on people’s bodies.</p><p>“I apologize, it’s such a typical thing for celebrities that I assumed this was the case. Again I apologize and God bless,” The critic wrote.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adrienne-bailon-addresses-plastic-surgery-talk-with-positivity>Adrienne Bailon Addresses Plastic Surgery Talk With Positivity</h2><p>The singer and TV personality spoke with ET backstage at the 2023 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daytime Emmy Awards</a> about the recent plastic surgery speculation. Rather than get upset, Bailon took the comment as a compliment.</p><p>She admitted it was hard to stay in shape after having a baby, so hearing someone suggest she paid for surgery made her feel like she must look great. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bailon</a> attributes the speculation to the insecurities many women have about their self-image. While the critic didn’t see her cellulite, she still appeared perfect to them.</p><p>Bailon welcomed a baby boy, Ever, via surrogate in 2022. Reflecting on the past year, she described it as “crazy but super special.” Motherhood has been an adjustment, like when her son accidentally head-butted her the morning of the Emmys. But she laughs about the joys and challenges of parenting.</p><p>In the coming year, Bailon looks forward to more of a routine of staying home and working. She also plans to record Latin-inspired party music in her home studio for a potential 2025 release. While unsure of a music comeback, she enjoys making fitness a priority and wants to spread more positivity through her platform.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_LightBalance_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpg alt="7 ‘Got Talent’ Acts That Earned The Golden Buzzer 2 Times" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xZqlrGWXnsOmecCdqaKdnqOybq7AoqOopl2ptaa10WaqrqigpL%2B1ecCmoJ1loKGutMDInGSsraKcsrPFjJqanK2jlsGqu82sZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
