In preparation for the FIFA World Cup, the ball was unveiled on 30 March 2022. The Al Rihla is the fourteenth successive World Cup product by Adidas.</p><h2>The FIFA World Cup 2022 ball</h2><p class=align-left>The ball's name, Al Rihla, means 'the journey' or 'the excursion' in Arabic. The name could also be interpreted as the journey's travelogue, referring to the host nation's journey to becoming the first Arabic nation to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">host the World Cup</a> amid controversy and corruption allegations.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4e0f987e8a904b5a.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Super Eagles star aims for 2026 World Cup semifinal amid qualification challenges</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/4e0f987e8a904b5a.jpeg><h3>Adidas FIFA World Cup 2022 ball</h3><p class=align-left>Adidas has been the official manufacturer of World Cup balls since 1970. The German corporation is the second-largest manufacturer of sporting goods worldwide and supplies kits for many soccer teams and clubs worldwide. The Al Rihla is said to travel faster in flight than any other one in the tournament's history to sustain high speed and quality competition.</p><h3>Physical design</h3><p class=align-left>Adidas used a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">20-panel design</a> inspired by Qatar's architecture, art and national flag. It has modern multicoloured etches on a white base. The panels are triangular, reminiscent of the sails on dhow boats that are popular in the Gulf state. Contrary to popular belief, the colour scheme is not of the night Doha skyline but of the Qatari flag and the white Arabic clothes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/1e6b3e9e21ed74c6.jpeg><h3>Functional design</h3><p class=align-left>The manufacturers accounted for environmental factors during the <a href=#>games</a> because the tournament will be held in one of the hottest and windiest places globally. They came up with the speedshell innovation, a polyurethane leather surface with pitted panels bonded thermally to make it seamless. The design improves the aerodynamic speed of shots by maintaining stability and rotation in the air.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ffae670d28b7bfc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Funniest moments of Paris 2024 Olympics including Turkish shooter with insane aura</span></p></a><h3>Technological design</h3><p class=align-left>The ball was designed per sustainability and eco-friendliness standards, making it the first ever with water-based glues and inks. Designers included a semi-automated offside technology to improve the speed and accuracy of match decisions. The technology was successfully tested at the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup and will see video match officials receive offside alerts, verifying determinations manually before communicating to the on-field referee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/9d310d9b072a967a.jpeg><p class=align-left>The work of art was created from the inside out, including a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CRT core bladder</a> that gives the best shape and rebound ability, contributing to better speed and accuracy in intense matches. Rigorous testing at Adidas labs, wind tunnels, and by footballers has proven the added advantages of the new design.</p><h3>The FIFA World Cup 2022 ball price</h3><p class=align-left>The product is retailing at $165 at the Adidas online shop. Other <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sporting goods shops</a> also stock the new model. Though the price may seem steep, it is considerate of the new designs implemented in its manufacture. 1% of the football's sales will go toward the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Common Goal movement</a>, making it the first one in the 92-year history of the contest to directly contribute to raising funds to impact lives positively.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/3e7e3134a1627baa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 of the best World Cup goal celebrations in the history of the competition</span></p></a><h3>In which country was the FIFA World Cup 2022 ball made?</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Forward Sports</a>, a company based in Sialkot in Northeastern Pakistan, is subcontracted by Adidas to make World Cup balls. Together with China, they made and supplied environmentally friendly, thermal-bonded WC merchandise, as they have since 1990. The company also made merch for Ligue 1, Bundesliga, and the Champions League.</p><h3>FIFA World Cup 2022 ball weight</h3><p class=align-left>The match ball weighs <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">450 grams</a> or 16 oz to make it light in the air and improve speed. It has a circumference of 70cm or 28 inches, with a pressure of 1.1 atmospheres or 1100g/cm2 or 15.6 lbs/sq in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ffae670d28b7bfc.jpeg><p class=align-left>Fans and pundits who want to see it in person could attend the tournament in Qatar or find pictures of the item on various platforms online.

It was made by Adidas, respecting climate change patterns and sustainability. It is a design upgrade from the Telstar Mechta used in the 2018 Russia World Cup.</p><h4><strong>Why is the World Cup ball Adidas?</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Adidas has partnered with FIFA to make the WC balls since 1970.
