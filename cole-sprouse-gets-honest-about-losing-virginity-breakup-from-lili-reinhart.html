In addition to sharing the story of how he lost his virginity, Sprouse also discussed his breakup with Riverdale co-star Lili Reinhart.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cole-sprouse-gets-honest-in-new-podcast-interview>Cole Sprouse Gets Honest in New Podcast Interview</h2><p>As well as talking about his experience in the entertainment industry and his parents’ divorce, Sprouse also got candid in the new podcast about losing his virginity at the age of 14 during a family trip to Florida.</p><p>“I met this girl who was older, so that’s already dubious,” Sprouse shared. The actor was embarrassed as he admitted that he asked the girl if she was “DTF,” or “down to f*ck.” He went on to say that it “lasted about 20 seconds” and he “never talked to her again.”</p><p>Sprouse said that after this experience, he became a “serial monogamist.” Although he said he finds the story “quite funny,” he also regrets that he “hadn’t made it special at all.”</p><p>The actor also shared that he’s been “emotionally” cheated on “by almost every single one of my girlfriends.” He added that his first girlfriend also physically cheated on him. However, Sprouse said he doesn’t blame his exes, sharing that most of his relationships “had a stronger sexual foundation than an emotional foundation.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JOJO SIWA REVEALS A BIG SECRET ON MEGHAN TRAINOR’S PODCAST</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sprouse-talks-about-breakup-with-lili-reinhart>Sprouse Talks About Breakup with Lili Reinhart</h2><p>During his conversation with Cooper, Sprouse also discussed his breakup with his Riverdale co-star Lili Reinhart, saying it was “really hard for both of us.” The pair split in 2020 after dating on and off for three years.</p><p>“I think the work thing got difficult, because it was hard to suspend all of the way we felt about each other,” Cole explained. “And it didn’t afford us the luxury of distance to really overcome that. I know we both did quite a bit of damage to each other. We’re good friends now, which is awesome. We work really well together now.”</p><p>He also said the rumors surrounding their breakup affected his mental health. Although he didn’t go into exactly why the relationship ended, he did say that “it was mutual.” When pressed about it, Sprouse admitted, “I left.”</p><p>Sprouse also said that his current relationship with model Ari Fournier “woke me up to what real compatibility and trust looks like in a way that I have never had before.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_MileyCyrus_Arturo-HolmesGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Miley Cyrus Stuns in New Album, Music Video, Disney+ Documentary" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Cole Sprouse</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqijnmWjpb%2BwwdKeZKCdpKh6qbvNnqqtZZGXvLbAjKWmrKGenHq3tdGgoKehpK56o77EmqKuqF2bv7C5jKWgpaFdp7Kquseaqa1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
