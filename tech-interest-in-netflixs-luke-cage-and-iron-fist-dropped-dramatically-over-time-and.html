That number took a huge dive when the second season was released this June, with less than 50,000 posts.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-81ccc26c-b8f9-50a8-90de-f686fa562d82 data-caption=null><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/L8lktkpTURBXy8wZTBiNWEyYWZmNmZhYjFhODM5OWEwMWY3MGExYjQ3MC5wbmeRlQLNAxbNAdfCww></span><p>The same can be said for "Iron Fist." The critically panned series improved slightly in its second season, but social-media reaction was still sparse compared to its first season. When the first season debuted last year, it inspired almost 120,000 posts on Twitter and Instagram. The second season peaked at less than 20,000.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ca893482-ce26-430f-bbb7-bdc4605c5baf data-caption=null><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/7D0ktkpTURBXy84ZDA0ZWIzYjE4YWMxNGI0Y2RkZDBjOThjNTMzYjU2Ni5wbmeRlQLNAxbNAdXCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The good news for "Daredevil" and "Jessica Jones" is that the results aren't as dramatic as for "Luke Cage" and "Iron Fist." The bad news is that there is a noticeable pattern in that interest has wavered after the shows' first seasons.</p><p>There were nearly 300,000 posts on Twitter and Instagram for the first season of "Jessica Jones." That was cut in half when the second season was released this year.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-1bfd6980-0b08-4e49-a7a0-7fba18014664 data-caption=null><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/6YbktkpTURBXy9iMzlmODE2ODhjNDBkNTRjYjRjNWMwYWEzMTI3MWQ0ZS5wbmeRlQLNAxbNAdfCww></span><p>"Daredevil," the longest-running Netflix Marvel show so far at three seasons, has seen a drop in social-media buzz over time, but less so than the other shows. The first season in 2015 saw nearly 275,000 posts, while season two saw a little over 200,000. That's not a huge drop, and the recently released third season inspired around 75,000 posts halfway through October, meaning that number could increase by month's end.</p><p>If any of the shows was safe, it would probably be "Daredevil" based on this data, but the pattern still holds.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7d596a20-d368-4f9d-a68b-7fd02bf26fc6 data-caption=null><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/CG2ktkpTURBXy8yNWY5MjM0YTAzNjNmNGNkZTlmNWVhYzExN2FhNDEyYi5wbmeRlQLNAxbNAdLCww></span><p>Crimson Hexagon also found that sentiment for the four shows has been mostly positive, the highest being for "Daredevil" at 79% and the lowest being for "Iron Fist" at 53%. But it's apparent that buzz around the shows has decreased.</p><p>There could be plenty of reasons for why Netflix canceled "Luke Cage" and "Iron Fist."</p><p>Disney is set to terminate a contract with Netflix at the end of the year, and while it has said that it has no plans to move the shows from Netflix, the competitive landscape of the streaming business could force its hand.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But this data also suggests that audiences just haven't been as interested in the shows as Netflix may have liked, and later seasons didn't generate the excitement of their first seasons.</p><p>There is only one season for the other shows, "The Defenders" and "The Punisher," so we couldn't compare data. The second season of "The Punisher" wrapped filming this summer. Only time will tell its fate, and that of "Daredevil" and "Jessica Jones."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWekmrCpecinq56qlajBbrXNZqWerJahtrm%2FjKWspJ1dmK6osYyapZ1lmae8r3nFoqqtZZSnvLG8xJ1knaqRoq61tcKao6WxXaTDpr6MraCmnV2Wu6V71qukrWtioA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
