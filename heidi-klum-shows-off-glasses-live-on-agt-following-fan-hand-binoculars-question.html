Amidst the excitement of the competition, the host Terry Crews added a humorous touch to the proceedings by addressing a unique aspect of judge Heidi Klum’s judging style, her “hand binoculars.” However, what really stole the show was Klum’s response, where she revealed a pair of glasses, which left everyone surprised of her timeless glamour.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-klum-shows-off-her-glasses>Heidi Klum Shows Off Her Glasses</h2><p>During the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terry Crews</a> read a social media comment from a viewer in Ohio who jokingly suggested that someone should “tell Heidi to get a pair of glasses.” The room’s reaction to this humorous remark was a mixture of laughter and curiosity, setting the stage for Klum to provide an explanation for her distinctive “hand binoculars.”</p><p>“Well, my hand binoculars, they’re just to cut out the light so sometimes if they’re up in the air and I can’t see them well, I cut the light like this.” Klum said. “I do have glasses but I’m too vain to wear them.”</p><p>She demonstrated her hand binocular gesture, bringing smiles to those in the studio. Afterward in a surprise move, she revealed a pair of glasses she had been concealing and put them on.</p><p>The audience erupted into applause and laughter as Klum donned her glasses, instantly transforming her look into one of sophisticated elegance. Her fellow judges, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Howie Mandel</a> and Sofia Vergara, joined in the light-hearted banter, with Sofia Vergara offering her unwavering support, insisting that Klum looks fabulous in glasses.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-heidi-klum-also-has-real-binoculars>Heidi Klum Also Has Real Binoculars</h2><p>Klum has long been known for her quirky use of fake binoculars during auditions, a trademark gesture that adds a touch of humor to the show. However, last season 17 of the show, fellow judge Mandel presented Klum with a thoughtful gift—a pair of real <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">binoculars</a>.</p><p>Although the said binoculars have yet to make an appearance again on AGT Season 18, her glasses provided a recent comic relief for the show.</p><p>“People always wonder about my binoculars, but you guys should try this once, and then you’ll see what I mean,” Klum said. “There’s so much light and colors and things going on that it’s sometimes very hard to focus on the act.”</p><p>Klum’s explanation for her hand binoculars is quite practical. When an act requires intense focus on small details, she raises her hands to her face and creates imaginary lenses with her fingers around her eyes. While this may seem like a whimsical approach, Klum assures us that it serves a purpose.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_OneDirection_SimonCowell_Dave-J-HoganGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Simon Cowell Predicts One Direction’s Success In Never-Before-Seen Footage From ‘The X Factor’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x56gnaFdoLm2uYysn6ivo2K8p7KMoKOaq6OawG64yK%2BcZqeeYq6owIyfpqWkn6y2r7OMn5inZZiWu6V5waKlqJuloa6zv4yqrJ6rpJ68r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
