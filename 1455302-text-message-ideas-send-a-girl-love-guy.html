First, you need to get close to her and find out what she thinks about you. Before you move to begin to woo her, first of all, gauge her relationship and its pro and cons, whether they are likely to separate. Regardless of the situation, you will be prepared how best to win her over.</p><p class=align-left>Here are tips on what to do to win her when the person you love loves someone else.</p><h3>1. Ask about her interests</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to become friends, you need to ask her questions about her interests. Showing interest in her passions will bond you two instantly and forge a friendship. You can focus on questions around what she is proud of her accomplishments, traits, skills, favourite TV shows and movies, and her opinion about things.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c67ce040935e36f4.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Compilation of the best love messages for your boyfriend</span></p></a><h3>2. Complement her personality</h3><p class=align-left>By now, you have learned a few things about her based on how she describes herself. First, women like to be appreciated for what they do or who they are. Although you love her, you should maintain being friends first; therefore, avoid <a href=#>complimenting her</a> attractive as this might be uncomfortable bearing she loves someone else already.</p><p class=align-left>You should be specific and sincere in appreciating something about her personality. Besides, although they like compliments, you should not overdo it with too much praise as this comes off as desperate.</p><h3>3. Help her out</h3><p class=align-left>Doing acts of service has proven to be the best way of expressing your love in a friendly way. People always need help with something, and showing it to her can express your care. You can pick her out, accompany her to an event or even cook her meal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dd0a09268847b963.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Take advantage of these love quotes for wife to make her heart melt!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These deeds show your reliability as a friend, and rather than telling her how you feel about it, show her. Indeed, Actions speaks louder than words.</p><h3>4. Make her laugh</h3><p class=align-left>Everyone likes to be happy and around happy people. It’s no doubt that women like funny people who make them laugh. If you make her laugh, she will always look forward to meeting you and elevating her moods. Good times will always strengthen your friendship.</p><h3>5. Have inside jokes between you two only</h3><p class=align-left>Having jokes and funny lines that only you two understand spices up your friendship and makes it more intimate, thus making it stronger.</p><h3>6. Do not flirt</h3><p class=align-left>You need to tone down the romantic part. Although you like her, you should not ruin your friendship by letting your feelings away too early. Flirting will make things so uncomfortable if you’ve not built the trust first.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7377e71cd2eda216.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75 best examples of a good morning love text for her</span></p></a><h3>7. Act the way you would around your male friends</h3><p class=align-left>Before a woman trusts you, she needs to be sure you’re not putting an act. You need to act the same way around her and your friends too. Nothing should change. Besides, you should never try to impress her around her friends and your friends too.</p><h3>8. Spend quality time with her</h3><p class=align-left>Women like attention. When you give her undivided attention and spend hours together, your relationship is bound to grow. You can achieve this by <a href=#>having quality conversations</a> that will keep her looking forward to being with you. Besides, listen to her feelings and let her talk without distraction, not just you.</p><h3>9. Comfort her</h3><p class=align-left>Offer a shoulder for her to lean on when she is going through a difficult time. You can also try and reach her out even when she doesn’t ask for it. You should offer her emotional support and even help her in decision making. However, refrain from doing too much. You’re giving help, and you want her input too.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f28dbbb610bdea01.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best pick up lines to get the girl of your dreams</span></p></a><h3>10. Express your feelings</h3><p class=align-left>You can now tell her the truth when your friendship deepens, and your feelings cannot be hidden anymore. You should express your emotions in the best way possible. Be completely open emotionally.</p><p class=align-left>She will be surprised, so do not do it harshly. Just be clear about how you feel and don’t have expectations after expressing yourself. Just beware it might cost your friendship with her as most times, she might not have seen the romantic feelings you had.</p><p class=align-left>Finally, remember that she loves someone else, and you should respect her current love situation. By telling her how you feel, it’s no doubt you’ve put her in a difficult position. You should therefore honour her decision whether at the moment or later.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>How to have a fun conversation with your girlfriend: 25 things to talk about</a></p><p class=align-left>Do you want to know how to strike up a conversation with your girlfriend?
