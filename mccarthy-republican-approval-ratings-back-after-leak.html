Plus, only a handful of Republican lawmakers —&nbsp;far-right figures such as Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida or Andy Biggs of Arizona —&nbsp;have attacked McCarthy, while more influential members, such as Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, have reiterated their support for him.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>told Politico</a>, “it’s all inside baseball,” adding that, “not a single constituent brought up that issue to me.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While it is true that few Republican voters are paying close attention to the story, it didn’t totally fly under the radar.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>GOP voters’ awareness of McCarthy’s issues</strong></h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Another Morning Consult survey conducted as the initial tape recording emerged found that 21% of Republican voters said they had seen, read or heard something “mainly negative” in the news about McCarthy, up from 13% the prior week.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Like most mainstream news stories, particularly those critical of Republicans, the latest survey found Democratic voters are more than twice as likely as Republicans to say they’d heard “a lot” about the Trump-related tape, 26% to 12%, lending credence to Davis’ point.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">In a previous survey, even fewer voters (16% of Democrats and 9% of Republicans) said they heard a lot about Martin’s and Burns’ report that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called Trump an expletive and accused him of committing an impeachable offense immediately after the Jan. 6 attack. Two in 5 Republican voters hold favorable views of him and just as many disfavor him, which are within the margin of error of his popularity at the beginning of April.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOppqcmaKptbp50Z6nrpqcnrCiuoyap6mqn6uurXnRmquippeoeqOtwqRkmp6kmr9uuMSaog%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
