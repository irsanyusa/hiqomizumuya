Born on&nbsp;April&nbsp;22, 1937, and raised in&nbsp;Manasquan, New Jersey, Nicholson appeared to&nbsp;live an&nbsp;ordinary middle-class life with his parents, John and Ethel May Nicholson, and his sisters, Lorraine and June Nicholson. However, in&nbsp;1974, when Jack Nicholson was 37&nbsp;years old, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>curious</a> <i>Time</i> magazine reporter revealed that John and Ethel May were not his parents, but his grandparents. Shockingly, the boy’s mother was June, the woman he&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;his sister.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/711/08c/fe0fc05647ba52095b6f82e610.jpg><p>MCMULLAN COEAST NEWS/East News</p><p>This revelation came about due to&nbsp;social norms at&nbsp;the time. June Nicholson was unmarried and only 17&nbsp;years old when she had Jack Nicholson. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, she asked her parents to&nbsp;raise him as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;were their own. Unfortunately, both June and Ethel May Nicholson passed away before the actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discovered</a> the truth about his biological parents.</p><p>Despite the startling news, Nicholson commented that since he&nbsp;learned about it&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult, it&nbsp;didn’t have as&nbsp;great an&nbsp;impact on&nbsp;him psychologically as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might have if&nbsp;he&nbsp;had found out earlier in&nbsp;life.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;turned down the role of&nbsp;Michael Corleone in&nbsp;<i>The Godfather</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c58/ffb/3a118c54ffb3bdec97dab66ee1.jpg><p>BIGPICTURESPHOTO.COM: 938/GCC/EAST NEWS</p><p>During the making of&nbsp;the 1972 mob classic, <i>The Godfather</i>, it&nbsp;seemed that everyone in&nbsp;Hollywood was either reported, presumed, assumed, or&nbsp;rumored to&nbsp;have turned down a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the film. However, in&nbsp;Jack Nicholson’s case, it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;rumor.</p><p>He&nbsp;openly admitted that he&nbsp;declined the opportunity. Nicholson believed that the role should be&nbsp;played by&nbsp;an&nbsp;Italian person, and he&nbsp;felt that he&nbsp;was not the right fit. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;turned down the original Godfather because&nbsp;I thought it&nbsp;should’ve been played by&nbsp;an&nbsp;Italian. I&nbsp;both do&nbsp;and don’t regret that decision, but&nbsp;I know it&nbsp;was right. <a href=#>Al&nbsp;Pacino</a> was the perfect actor for&nbsp;it, and the picture is&nbsp;better because of&nbsp;him.”</p><p><h2>His role as&nbsp;Joker in&nbsp;<i>Batman</i> not only made him one of&nbsp;the most famous but also one of&nbsp;the wealthiest actors in&nbsp;Hollywood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1f4/ab0/d0ec5058fba100640b3e5518ca.png><p>Tim Burton’s 1989&nbsp;film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Batman</i></a>, was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>smash</a> hit during a&nbsp;time when <a href=#>comic book movies</a> were not guaranteed success. Warner Bros. had little idea of&nbsp;the movie’s potential.</p><p>But Nicholson, who played the <a href=# title=Joker data-link=tag>Joker</a>, could see it&nbsp;coming and arranged a&nbsp;deal in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;would receive a&nbsp;percentage of&nbsp;the merchandising profits.

So, to&nbsp;prepare for a&nbsp;big intimate scene, Nicholson spent 3&nbsp;months wandering around his home naked, getting to&nbsp;know his inner naturalist and becoming comfortable in&nbsp;his own skin no&nbsp;matter who stopped by&nbsp;his house.</p><p>“I&nbsp;felt it&nbsp;was totally necessary. I’m self-conscious about body image. I&nbsp;don’t have a&nbsp;great body shot. And it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;era of ’let’s get free.’ I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;drove my&nbsp;oldest daughter insane. I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more relaxed within my&nbsp;skin,” Nicholson revealed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><p>The actor enjoyed being naked so&nbsp;much, that even after the 3-month period, he&nbsp;attended some interviews completely naked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/194/598/af29db5b699dde7707391efc39.jpg><p>AA/ABACA/EAST NEWS</p><p>Nicholson’s first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>child</a>, Jennifer Nicholson, was born in&nbsp;1963 when he&nbsp;was married to&nbsp;Sandra Knight.&nbsp;7&nbsp;years later, he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;father to&nbsp;son Caleb Goddard with his <i>Five Easy Pieces</i> co-star, Susan Anspach. The actress married Mark Goddard while she was pregnant with Nicholson’s son, and 25&nbsp;years later, Nicholson publicly denied paternity, although his son Caleb told <i>People </i>magazine that the actor recognized him as&nbsp;his son in&nbsp;private.</p><p>In&nbsp;1981, Nicholson had his third child, Honey Hollman, with model Winnie Hollman. He&nbsp;shares his fourth and fifth children, daughter Lorraine and son Ray Nicholson with actress Rebecca Broussard.
