Britain’s own contribution to the curry world – the tikka masala – comes in second with 12%.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Favourite20curry20type-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The milder curries' presence at the top of the charts is down to their particular popularity among two demographic groups: women and younger people.</p><p>Women are much more likely to opt for a mild curry than men. Korma is the preferred curry of nearly a quarter (23%) of women, a full 10 percentage points more than men. On the spice scale, twice as many men as women say that one of the three curries we have classified as ‘hot’ – the jalfrezi, the madras and the vindaloo – is their favourite.</p><p>Young people are also noticeably steering clear of hotter curries. Just 1% of 18-24 year olds say that a madras is their favourite curry, as well as a statistical 0% for jalfrezis and vindaloos. Instead, they are much more likely to opt for a korma (32%) or a tikka masala (18%) than older age groups.</p><p><b>Britain's top curry</b></p><p>Chicken is by far the main ingredient people most want in their curry – almost three in five (59%) say that it is their favourite, compared to just one in five (20%) who choose lamb.</p><p>Combining the figures for favourite curry sauce and favourite main ingredient reveals the single most popular curry in Britain: the chicken korma, with 15% choosing this precise dish. The chicken tikka masala comes in close behind, on 12%.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Top20520curries-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The top five curry combinations are rounded off by chicken jalfrezi (6%), chicken balti (5%) and lamb rogan josh (4%, and the only curry where lamb was more popular than chicken).</p><p>Moving on to side dishes, pilau rice is by far the preferred rice to accompany a curry. With more than half of people (55%) saying that it is their favourite rice to have with a curry, it is more than three times more popular than the next type (plain, 18%).</p><p>The public are much more divided when it comes to their favourite naan bread. Three in ten prefer garlic naan (31%) followed by plain naan at 25% and peshwari naan at 22%. The keema naan is somewhat left behind, being the choice of just one in ten (11%).</p><p>Photo: iStockphoto</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpZ2WGc3nPqKepmZSkuqq6wKerZqOfp7qiedGerZ6ZnJqxbq7EZpmroaSWtq%2B%2FjJ%2BYr6elp7a1sQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
