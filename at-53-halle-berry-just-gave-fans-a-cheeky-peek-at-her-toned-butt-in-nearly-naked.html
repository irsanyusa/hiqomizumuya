" Halle captioned the post.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>And Halle's fans were quick to praise the photo. "Beautiful " one commented wrote. "Woah!" wrote another.</p><p>So, how does Halle stay so fit with so much going on? The Academy Award-winner works out regularly with trainer Peter Lee Thomas, who is also a regular feature on her Instagram. Thomas told <a href=# id=88638537-97c9-3804-a98e-35375c20cb57>People</a> he likes to challenge Halle with a combination of exercise techniques, including martial arts, boxing, and yoga. He also raved to the magazine about her work ethic in the gym. "I had no idea what her age was when I met her," he said in 2018. "I never looked or was interested in that, and when I found out, I was absolutely shell-shocked because she has the discipline and athleticism of a 25-year old."</p><p>In addition to her training, Halle has also stuck to a high fat, moderate protein, very low-carb ketogenic diet for years, which helps her manage her weight and her diabetes (she was diagnosed with the condition when she was 22), she told <a href=# id=73190ddf-81e0-315f-ab16-b51799082917>LIVE with Kelly and Ryan</a> .</p><p>For one last bit of #fitspo, Halle starts each new year by sharing her fitness goals for the next 365 days. This year, she hopes to maintain a daily 30-minute meditation practice, she wrote on <a href=# id=6beaf7dc-cc92-3caa-a276-41a691b374fc>Instagram</a> . Oh, and because one challenge isn't enough, she also hopes to earn another belt in Jiu Jitsu by the end of 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOmqtmbWNitaK4y55km52ip8ZuttSsq2afkauybrLAp6pmmV2YtaaxyrJkqZ2VoHqiwIyhnKtlpKS7prCMm6ytrF2eu266xJqppbFdo66sscNoqa9xZK%2B3pA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
