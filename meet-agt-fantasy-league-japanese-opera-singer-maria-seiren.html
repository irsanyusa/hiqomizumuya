Let’s get to know her better.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maria-seiren-s-vocals-transcend-beyond-labels>Maria Seiren’s Vocals Transcend Beyond Labels</h2><p>Seiren began training her vocals when she was in high school when she joined the school choir. According to her, her mother would frequently sing Japanese songs to her. At the time, she wasn’t really interested in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">opera</a>.</p><p>However, she had always sung as a high soprano, ever since she was a kid. While people had the guts to point out that her voice wasn’t “manly enough,” Seiren wasn’t one to be bothered.</p><p>“I never let that kind of thing bother me, and I never gave in to the bullies who teased me. Actually, I really hated it when my voice broke and I began singing in a lower tone. I was always pushing myself to sing higher and I think that complex is what drove me to develop the ability to sing in both registers,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>Revealing the origin behind her stage name, she explained that Seiren comes from the mythological Greek figure of the siren who lure sailors with their songs. Meanwhile, Maria comes from the Virgin Mary.</p><p>“So, within one person there is the capacity for different states of being. Good and evil, purity and impurity, life and death, man and woman. The idea that we can move fluidly between these parallels is one of the major themes of my work, and it really embodies who I am,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-s-set-to-compete-on-agt-fantasy-league>She’s Set to Compete on AGT: Fantasy League</h2><p>While she is a solo artist, she said that she never feels “completely alone” when she goes up on stage. As Seiren explained, she trusts a lot of people with her hard, makeup, and outfits. Thus, when she performs, she brings them on stage in spirit.</p><p>Now that she’ll be joining <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT: Fantasy League</a>, she recognizes the responsibility she needs to carry.</p><p>“Before the win, I was just a singer. Now, I’m a representative of Japan and about to head to the US as the winner of our country’s first Got Talent competition. So, there are more expectations. But it’s also a really incredible challenge to take on,” she said.</p><p>If you want to witness Maria Seiren’s journey on the spinoff, be sure to tune in on the show. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League</a> premieres Monday, Jan. 1 at 8 p.m. ET on NBC and will stream the next day on Peacock.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_AleshaDixon_AmandaHolden_Eamonn-M.-McCormackGetty-Images-220x146.jpg alt="Global ‘Got Talent’ Judges We Would Love to See on ‘America’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRnMFussCnq5qrqWK5pq3GrpxmopGlrq%2Bx0p5kqKiVp65uv8innp6qXaKus7XAZqqeoaKau3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
