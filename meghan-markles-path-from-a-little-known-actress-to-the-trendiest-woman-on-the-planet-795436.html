Before Meghan Markle became the style icon, she was a little-known actress and used to choose simple, less-well-thought-out outfits. But her new status and a good stylist helped her discover her style and learn several important lessons.
1. Meghan is not scared of experimenting with proportions.

But her new status and a&nbsp;good stylist helped her discover her style and learn several important lessons.</p><p><h2>1. Meghan is&nbsp;not scared of&nbsp;experimenting with proportions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/506/a3a/f3dce353939a6139bcf4d48c1a.jpg><p>The vertical stripes make the silhouette of&nbsp;the Duchess taller. And the horizontal stripes highlight her body shape.</p><p>Despite being pretty thin, the body of&nbsp;the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex is&nbsp;not ideal. She has broad shoulders, narrow hips, and a&nbsp;slightly undefined waist. But when you look at&nbsp;her, it’s not like you can see it&nbsp;right away. Meghan and her stylist use the right clothes in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;accentuate her best features and hide her flaws.</p><p>In&nbsp;all of&nbsp;her outfits, you can always see the waist&nbsp;— it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;highlighted with color, a&nbsp;pattern, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;belt. Very often, she uses medium-length dresses to&nbsp;highlight her thin and elegant ankles. And her broad shoulders are balanced with a&nbsp;wider lower half. But it&nbsp;seems that Meghan is&nbsp;not very worried about her broad shoulders. She often violates the royal dress code and wears dresses that leave her shoulders exposed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/315/960/62d4ed51bc9e1ebfc6be17b2a4.jpg><p><h2>2. She prefers deep colors and modern or&nbsp;classic patterns.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d3/f03/1daf1254778d4562764ab07560.jpg><p>While the Queen loves the old-fashioned flowery patterns and Kate Middleton likes polka-dots, Meghan prefers deep solid colors. Wine, marsala, emerald, and blueberry-blue look very noble. And black, white, or&nbsp;beige, with simple tailoring and good-looking <a href=# title=accessories data-link=tag>accessories</a> are modern classics.</p><p>But we&nbsp;can’t say that the Duchess doesn’t use patterns at&nbsp;all. Her wardrobe includes some clothes with stripes, geometric or&nbsp;ethnic ornaments, and more modern patterns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f5/277/35492c5017b33a6eb5240d7d74.jpg><p>Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle appeared at&nbsp;Wimbledon together in&nbsp;2018. After this appearance, Meghan’s outfit was discussed a&nbsp;lot: the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex didn’t just prefer pants instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;traditional dress, but she also chose a&nbsp;hat as&nbsp;an&nbsp;accessory. And she had to&nbsp;hold it&nbsp;in&nbsp;her hands during the entire event, because hats are prohibited for Wimbledon viewers since they might block somebody’s view.</p><p><h2>3. Meghan Markle chooses very feminine outfits.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ae/33c/5b96bc56adb9795beabe240fc3.jpg><p>For women, the royal dress code recommends sheath dresses and outfits made of&nbsp;thick fabrics, so&nbsp;that the wind doesn’t reveal any body parts of&nbsp;the royal family members. However, these clothes often make the look harsher or&nbsp;even make the person wearing them seem more arrogant (remember Elizabeth II&nbsp;in&nbsp;her sheath dresses).</p><p>This is&nbsp;why Meghan is&nbsp;so&nbsp;different from other members of&nbsp;the family: she tries to&nbsp;make her dresses look lighter and more feminine. The light fabrics show the fragility of&nbsp;the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex. And even when she has to&nbsp;attend some official events, she chooses the dresses that demonstrate her elegance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d0/deb/72fcdb5f27bf8631f64c25f242.jpg><p>The half-transparent part on&nbsp;this sheath dress makes it&nbsp;less official and more elegant.</p><p><h2>4. Meghan avoids the rules carefully.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb1/cc8/677a2e520caef7eb026018935b.jpg><p>A&nbsp;dress with a&nbsp;half-transparent top in&nbsp;an&nbsp;official photoshoot of&nbsp;a&nbsp;royal family member? It&nbsp;has become possible with the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex. During her very first official appearance as&nbsp;the bride of&nbsp;the prince, Meghan hinted that she was ready to&nbsp;modernize some of&nbsp;the old rules and she wants to&nbsp;keep things stylish.</p><p>Later, the wife of&nbsp;Prince Harry managed to&nbsp;skirt some other rules. Markle gave up&nbsp;wearing tights (which was a&nbsp;strict rule), she also started revealing her shoulders and playing with different necklines, instead of&nbsp;always wearing collars.</p><p>Here the Duchess is&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;black Club Monaco dress at&nbsp;the wedding of&nbsp;Charlie van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks. Internet users are still discussing the button on&nbsp;the dress and the beautiful underwear of&nbsp;Meghan Markle. They think the button was not an&nbsp;accident.</p><p><h2>5. She uses the elements of&nbsp;a&nbsp;modern basic wardrobe in&nbsp;her style.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/432/f2d/9d9013598c9ce82cff33d5325e.jpg><p>When she is&nbsp;not busy with official meetings, Meghan loves to&nbsp;dress in&nbsp;a&nbsp;casual style. The photos show her before the wedding and after.</p><p>Loose white shirts and jeans with holes are must-have clothes for women all around the world. But just not for the members of&nbsp;the royal family. They are too unofficial and frivolous. They make the royal family members look just like regular people.</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;has never really liked denim and she’s never liked other members of&nbsp;her family wearing denim. But Meghan has a&nbsp;different opinion. She likes to&nbsp;be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;regular people, so&nbsp;she adds clothing from a&nbsp;modern basic wardrobe to&nbsp;her royal wardrobe. Pleated skirts, sundresses, and even oversized clothes look stylish on&nbsp;the Duchess. And when she wears something like this, these clothes become sold out in&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;hours because they are not only good-looking, but also very comfortable.</p><p><h2>6. She pays a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;detail.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d58/d41/5533a25cfc90256dbc47190e74.jpg><p>Meghan pays a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;all the smallest details of&nbsp;her look, even if&nbsp;it’s just about the <a href=# title="nail polish" data-link=tag>nail polish</a> color. In&nbsp;2018, the Princess violated the royal dress code rule and appeared at&nbsp;the Fashion Awards ceremony with dark-red nail polish, which really surprised many people that know the etiquette rules.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/621/7c2/40b6e65571985a8c0c84243111.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/abf/6f4/bef5e1582f9eadf6da4cae6113.jpg><p>Also, despite the rules against wearing some bright shoes, Meghan often highlights her shoes. She is&nbsp;not afraid of&nbsp;experimenting with color, shape, heel height, and additional elements, adding stylish touches to&nbsp;the overall strict official outfit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b58/a63/7a2e935e2090e9a58affeead8d.jpg><p>After Meghan Markle appeared at&nbsp;a&nbsp;charity event in&nbsp;Nottingham, the Strathberry bag disappeared from the stores in&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;hours and can only be&nbsp;preordered now.</p><p>Meghan’s bags are a&nbsp;topic that needs a&nbsp;separate article. The accessories of&nbsp;the Duchess in&nbsp;Europe are so&nbsp;popular that when Meghan appears with a&nbsp;new bag, it&nbsp;immediately disappears from the stores forever.</p><p><h2>7. Meghan uses simple modern jewelry.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3a/d08/ef1c9e5e9885f89be4fd9e6dc7.jpg><p>Meghan knows how to&nbsp;combine stylish jewelry of&nbsp;the past, with jewelry of&nbsp;the present. You can see the Princess Diana <a href=#>bracelet</a> on&nbsp;her hand and several other, simple bracelets.</p><p>Grand, massive jewels with diamonds and pearls are a&nbsp;thing of&nbsp;the past. Not a&nbsp;single fashion house of&nbsp;today uses beads anymore and only the members of&nbsp;the royal family wear them.</p><p>The rest of&nbsp;the world has switched to&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple and minimalistic design. And here, Meghan Markle tries to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;up. She knows how to&nbsp;wear simple elegant jewels and she very rarely uses the old family jewels.</p><p><h2>8. She keeps track of&nbsp;the fashion trends and uses them to&nbsp;her advantage.</h2></p><p>Meghan Markle is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;woman who tries to&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;with all the fashion trends. However, she still manages to&nbsp;look like she is&nbsp;modern.</p><p>Her secret is&nbsp;that she is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;tell the modern basic clothes from the clothes of&nbsp;the past. She is&nbsp;also good at&nbsp;adapting fashion trends to&nbsp;suit her needs. She doesn’t wear any old-fashioned outfits, wild-looking colors, or&nbsp;outrageous decorative elements. When creating a&nbsp;look, the Duchess uses basic clothes, plus some more trendy pieces, making her look very natural and elegant.</p><p>For example, during the 2019&nbsp;Wimbledon, she was holding a&nbsp;trendy micro bag in&nbsp;her hands.</p><p>Compared to&nbsp;the other Princess, Kate Middleton, Meghan often looks more modern. And this is&nbsp;partially because she wears more modern clothes. Kate respects the traditions and she often uses outdated clothes (which are not trendy to&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;the world). And Meghan interprets the rules the way she sees fit, combining the royal style and the style of&nbsp;the modern era.</p><p>For example, compare Meghan’s classic coat and Kate’s new look coat. Meghan looks elegant and modern. And Kate only looks older than she really&nbsp;is.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4d/fdc/411ac75872ba81bb14423a992b.jpg><p>Kate’s new look coat: This style was popular in&nbsp;the 20th century. Meghan’s coat is&nbsp;the modern classic: simple tailoring and very few details.</p><p>Even though Meghan Markle’s wardrobe mostly consists of&nbsp;basic clothes, the Princess and her stylist watch the fashion shows. And then, they alter the haute-couture clothes to&nbsp;make them fit the royal family standards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f5/5d2/1f090b56e6b617da3307ccd3e0.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/962/732/f341db55c38aa3c8e0cf0a0ca5.jpg><p><h2>9. The Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex is&nbsp;not afraid of&nbsp;wearing good outfits and dresses twice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa5/2d7/12b7ea58a4936ff78060fe399f.jpg><p>Every time Prince Harry’s wife appears in&nbsp;public, she demonstrates her ability to&nbsp;combine things with each other. And she is&nbsp;totally okay with using some successful looks more than once. She even wears the same clothes twice.</p><p>A&nbsp;stylist helps Meghan to&nbsp;find some outer garments and accessories to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;new look to&nbsp;an&nbsp;old outfit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c06/c36/ddc7cd5f158502927e9b60d966.jpg><p><h2>10. She loves expressing her feelings.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f0/d5b/72deb056ff95eb59e5901a8477.jpg><p>The royal etiquette strictly prohibits expressing feelings to&nbsp;someone in&nbsp;public. Kissing your husband or&nbsp;your child, holding hands or&nbsp;showing your affection toward someone is&nbsp;totally inappropriate. And Meghan has already broken all these rules.</p><p>She and her husband often appear in&nbsp;public holding hands and sitting near each other at&nbsp;dinners, despite the original table seat plans. They touch each other and they look like completely happy people.</p><p>The Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex is&nbsp;always ready to&nbsp;communicate with her fans. And she does it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;less strict way than the rules say she should. She gives autographs, takes selfies with people, talks to&nbsp;children, and even hugs strangers.</p><p>Her openness and readiness to&nbsp;communicate make her look like a&nbsp;regular person. With her behavior, she shows that royal people are also people.</p><p><h2>11. She allows herself to&nbsp;make mistakes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b41/38f/47bdc95027b4b39d99cb6a90a9.jpg><p>The red dress that Meghan wore during her visit to&nbsp;Tonga still had the tag on&nbsp;it. And paparazzi noticed it&nbsp;and spread this information everywhere.</p><p>Just like most famous people, the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex has had some fashion failures. Paparazzi have seen the tags on&nbsp;the Princess’ clothes, and the plastic pieces on&nbsp;her bags. It&nbsp;looked as&nbsp;if&nbsp;Meghan has just left the store and forgotten to&nbsp;remove all these things. The haters criticized her for being messy and her fans said that these flaws only made her look even more elegant and real.</p><p>Meghan was very calm about the criticism. In&nbsp;the end, everyone makes mistakes and even the stylists of&nbsp;famous people&nbsp;do. The most important thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep cool and behave accordingly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/19e/a8c/7c75795d13a1c071a01bb47857.jpg><p>During her visit to&nbsp;New Zealand, you could literally see right through her pleated skirt. The Givenchy skirt was a&nbsp;failure.</p><p><h2>12. She is&nbsp;not afraid of&nbsp;being different and happy.</h2></p><p>Some haters and toxic people have judged Meghan Markle for wearing high heels and slim-fitted dresses when she was pregnant, they accused her of&nbsp;attracting too much attention her herself when she touched her belly in&nbsp;every photo. And they said quite a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;other unpleasant things about this Princess.</p><p>But all of&nbsp;these things didn’t make Meghan smile any less often or&nbsp;express less love to&nbsp;her child. And she hasn’t changed her clothes preferences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/349/ef4/020ee65cb6837425e2ed401204.jpg><p>Meghan Markle, the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex, has been making waves with her unconventional approach to&nbsp;post-pregnancy body image, refusing to&nbsp;succumb to&nbsp;societal pressures to&nbsp;rapidly lose baby weight. Instead, she’s chosen to&nbsp;<a href=#>embrace the natural changes</a> that come with motherhood, a&nbsp;move that has garnered both criticism and praise. This stance has been seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;body-positive message, inspiring women worldwide to&nbsp;not feel ashamed of&nbsp;their post-baby bodies.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;different light, even the Duchess of&nbsp;Sussex isn’t immune to&nbsp;the occasional wardrobe mishap. During a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;Tonga, Meghan was spotted with the <a href=#>price tag</a> still attached to&nbsp;her dress, a&nbsp;relatable moment that reminds&nbsp;us that celebrities are human too, prone to&nbsp;the same everyday oversights as&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;us.</p><p>Finally, the power of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong support network is&nbsp;highlighted in&nbsp;the relationship between Meghan Markle and Beyoncé. The two women, successful in&nbsp;their respective fields, have shown <a href=#>mutual admiration and respect</a> for each other. This bond underscores the importance of&nbsp;support and camaraderie, not just in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;adversity, but also in&nbsp;celebrating each other’s accomplishments.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you like her style?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqms8eapWalkae4rbHSZqearJhis7O7zGaYZqSZqcGtsYykpaivnmKupMDRnqqsZaSkerW0xGarq52embamv9NmrqilkaN6sLqMrZ%2BeZaChrq%2Bx02Zucm1kaINw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
