That was when Taylor’s star-studded squad reached new levels of public prominence and her <a href=# rel=noopener>annual Fourth of July bash</a> became a much larger part of the pop culture canon. She even had a birthday party that <a href=# rel=noopener>Jay Z and Beyoncé attended</a>. So it’s pretty much safe to say that this might have been the peak “nice things” that she refers to in the song.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Taylor alludes to why she’s been so quiet lately:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This year, Taylor <a href=# rel=noopener>laid low</a> and rarely posted on her social media accounts, a vast contrast to her effusive online presence beforehand. She even chose not to host her <a href=# rel=noopener>annual Fourth of July bash</a> in Rhode Island, much to the disappointment of the Swifties. She could be addressing this with the line in the song: “I’m shaking my head, I’m locking the gates.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Taylor seems to set the the stage for her renewed conflict with Kanye:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If we’re really going to be able to understand this one, we need to look at why <a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Swift and Kanye West clashed</a> in the first place. The brief explanation is this: Kanye stormed the stage when <a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor won “Best Female Video</a>” over Beyoncé. Both have talked about this incident repeatedly, but it all seemed hunky-dory when they were spotted talking at the <a href=# rel=noopener>Grammys</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Eventually, they <a href=# rel=noopener>officially reconciled at the 2015 VMAs</a>, when Taylor presented ‘Ye with his Video Vanguard Award and Kanye sent her flowers after the fact, which Swift shared on Instagram. For all intents and purposes, the pair considered themselves “friends,” something that feels especially significant when you consider this blistering line from “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things”: “It was so nice being friends again, there I was giving you a second chance, but you stabbed me in the back without shaking my hand.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Taylor Swift addresses that infamous phone call</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Taylor appears to address the infamous phone call that she had with Kanye about “Famous,” which was later <a href=# rel=noopener>shared online via Kim Kardashian West’s Snapchat</a> with this <a href=# rel=noopener>widely shared line</a>. “And therein lies the issues, friends don’t try to trick you, get you on the phone and mind twist you” reads Taylor’s lyrics, which is self-explanatory.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Taylor Swift engages in some clever wordplay that could reference Kanye West in two different ways</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift values friendships (squad anyone?) so she when she sings “but I’m not the only friend you’ve lost lately/if only you weren’t so shady,” she could be hitting West with this personal critique. It’s doubly interesting when you consider that Kanye has a 2016 song called “<a href=# rel=noopener>Real Friends</a>,” where he laments how hard it is to have true friends amid life changes and fame. He’s also had some public falling-outs with many of his friends in recent years, most notably, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jay Z</a>. “Real friends” could just be a common phrase, or Taylor could possibly be revisiting this and Kanye’s song directly with one of her final lines, “Here’s a toast to my real friends – they don’t care about that he said, she said.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Taylor Swift also could be referencing her longtime association with Katy Perry:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fellow pop princess <a href=# rel=noopener>Katy Perry was vocal about her issues with Swift</a> during promotional appearances for her album Witness. She memorably noted that she was “ready to let go” of the wounds and “forgive” her. Taylor stayed mum, but the lyrics of “This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things” might just speak for themselves: Swift sings “here’s to you because forgiveness is a nice thing to do,” before erupting in peals of laughter and saying that she “can’t even say it with a straight face.” Whether it was meant for Perry or West or someone else, it appears that Swift did not come to play.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaGFtf3l8jq2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2asmJ7AbrXSZq6hsV2ssm6vwKerZqCRq7JuusicnGasmJ67qL%2BMq5yfnaKau6Sx0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
