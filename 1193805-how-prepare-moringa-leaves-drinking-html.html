You will know that your leaves are ready to be used for making tea when they become crisp.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt524ilto5i97.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing benefits of unripe papaya fruit, water and seeds</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Tips:</strong> users who have a special food dehydrator can dry their leaves in a couple of hours.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Separate dry leaves from stalks if you want to.
