At&nbsp;first, she was only invited to&nbsp;play the roles of&nbsp;classic young ladies from the 20th century&nbsp;— just watch the films <a href=#>Lady Jane</a> or&nbsp;<a href=#>A&nbsp;Room with a&nbsp;View</a> where the young Bonham Carter doesn’t in&nbsp;the least resemble Bellatrix Lestrange or&nbsp;Sweeney Todd’s accomplice.</p></li><li readability=1.9700598802395><p>The first role that dramatically changed her career was the character of&nbsp;Marla in&nbsp;Fight Club. The actress got so&nbsp;connected with her character that she <a href=#>asked</a> the makeup artist to&nbsp;apply her makeup with her left hand.

It’s not clear whether this gave her a&nbsp;confidence boost or&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was the fact that Helena once met the Princess in&nbsp;person (the actress’s uncle was <a href=#>close</a> to&nbsp;Margaret), but she transformed into her brilliantly.</p></li><li readability=2.9132231404959><p>Helena Bonham Carter was <a href=#>awarded</a> the Order of&nbsp;the British Empire for her role of&nbsp;the Duchess Elizabeth, the mother of&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II, in&nbsp;the movie The King’s Speech.

The mark of&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful relationship shouldn’t be&nbsp;whether you’re there forever after. Sometimes, you’re not meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;forever together.
