"So she came up with her most diabolical [execution]. Ser Pounce's death was so horrible we couldn't even put it on the air."</p><p>This isn't the first time the death of a character has been left to the imagination of viewers. Cersei has also presumably killed Septa Unella, who was <a href=# id=c2aaa503-ca4b-3fe8-a4d6-976e8a35e048>last seen on the sixth season finale</a> in a dungeon. Same goes for Ellaria Sand, who was captured by Euron Greyjoy and brought to Queen Cersei. She was also last seen in a dungeon, <a href=# id=6111f12d-5346-314b-a8c4-2ccf6bb63e58>left to watch her daughter Tyene die</a> slowly from poison.</p><p>Ser Pounce's fate was previously unknown, since he was assumed to be alive somewhere in the Red Keep but without an owner. King Tommen <a href=# id=d32d73c3-7c90-37d7-a230-f653b735f23a>died by suicide on the sixth season finale</a> after he watched his wife Margaery get blown up in the Sept of Baelor thanks to a dastardly plot Cersei orchestrated.</p><p>Seeing Ser Pounce again on "Game of Thrones" was always a very minor possibility, but now fans will have to mourn the royal feline ahead of the eighth and final season.</p><p>"Game of Thrones" season eight premieres on April 14.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme9OhnGafkaKybrvFZquhqp%2BjsrR5wqucmqyfp8Buv8CyZJudnKTDprCMq6aymZxisKLAjKycq2WgpMKvr8RmrpqrXaLCs7DEq5ydZZKueqSx0aycomegbrN5vses</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
