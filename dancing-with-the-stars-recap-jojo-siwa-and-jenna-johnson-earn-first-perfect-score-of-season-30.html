From special guests to the first perfect score of the season from historic same-sex team JoJo Siwa and Jenna Johnson, tonight was all about creating and recreating iconic moments.</strong></p><p>Perhaps the most shocking moment of the night, for me, was host Tyra Banks admitting that she only saw Grease for the first time this past Saturday. Because she’s been living under a rock I guess? Anyway.</p><p>Olivia Newton John, who guest judged on DWTS Season 21, popped in via video to give her take on the night’s theme while Jim Jacobs, Grease co-creator, was in the audience. Didi Conn, who played Frenchie in the film, appeared via video ahead of Amanda Kloots’s performance as well as JoJo’s performance– the two highest scoring dances of the night.</p><p>Even recently eliminated contestant <a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a> was spotted watching from the audience as girlfriend and professional dancer Sharna Burgess joined the group dance.</p><p>Frankie Avalon was perhaps the most surprising guest of the night, singing “Beauty School Dropout” live in the ballroom as Amanda Kloots and Alan Bersten performed a nearly perfect Viennese Waltz. Judge Derek Hough was the only thing standing in the way of their perfect score.</p><p>“There is something for me I can’t quite put my finger on,” he said. “There’s like this moment I don’t know what it is whether it’s choreography or is it a move… I don’t know…that I want to tip it over the edge to give you that 10, for me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-first-perfect-score-of-the-season-goes-to-historic-same-sex-couple>First Perfect Score of the Season Goes to Historic Same-Sex Couple</h2><p>JoJo and Jenna earned a perfect score for their Foxtrot to “Look At Me, I’m Sandra Dee (Reprise).” Before the performance, rehearsal footage showed the two women bonding and gushing over their friendship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVMSDrUlRqz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>“This is the most connected I’ve ever been to a partner” Jenna said. “I feel like I’m your older sister and I want you to see how beautiful you are.”</p><p>JoJo admitted that she struggles with confidence and feeling self-conscious: “The one thing I preach and don’t practice is confidence,” she said.</p><p>After their beautiful slow dance, the audience was filled with emotion and respect for these two dancers.</p><p>“You affected my brain with the quality of the technique, you affected my heart with the artistry that you produced, it was superb,” said Goodman while Tonioli gave a typical response that he was “still shivering.”</p><p>The judges had nothing but praise for these two who did earn the first perfect score of the season, knocking JoJo onto the floor in excitement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Spice Girl Melanie C. Shockingly Eliminated</h2><p>After the judges’ scoring, Iman Shumpert and pro Daniella Karagach were at the bottom of the pack. They earned just 28 out of 40 after their <span>Viennese Waltz to “Hopelessly Devoted To You.”</span></p><p>I’ll just say, I’m an Iman fan. As amazing as Daniella is, this pairing puts the two at a disadvantage due to their huge height difference. Even Inaba addressed their heights tonight noting, <span>“Your knee is where her hip is</span>.”</p><p>Apparently Iman has some fans voting out there (I definitely voted 20 times so…) as Olivia Jade and Mel C. were the celebs shocking placed in the bottom two. Each scored 9s across the board with their partners, and their spot on the chopping block clearly shook the judges.</p><p>Hough voted to save Olivia and Val, Inaba and Tonioli went for Mel C. and Gleb, but it was up to <a href=#>head judge Goodman</a> who made the final decision to save Olivia and Val. This elimination was a shocking reminder to all that every little step counts at this point in the competition, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan voting matters more than ever</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/NUP_194865_04026.jpeg alt="Team Legend’s Strongest Battle of the Night goes to Sabrina and Jack" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars season 30</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlnKGenHq4tdOhZK2glWLAta3RrGSrnZOWvW62zqOmZquZrK5urc2dZKOdnqOubrbOoaWsp55isqK%2BzWadoqqjqXqxsdGfnJysXaiwsL7EZqafZaOarrS7zWZqaWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
