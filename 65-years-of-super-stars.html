This latest cinematic re-interpretation of the visitor-from-Krypton myth,&nbsp;Man of Steel (in theaters June 14), stars Henry Cavill, the caped fellow in the photo above, and is directed by Zack Snyder, the geek auteur behind 300 and Watchmen.</p><p>The movie is also the subject of a story in the latest issue of TIME. For his <a href=#>behind-the-scenes feature</a>, senior writer Lev Grossman interviewed Cavill and castmates Amy Adams (who plays Lois Lane) and Michael Shannon (the evil General Zod). Grossman also talked with the director — who had the considerable challenge of updating Superman for the 2013 world — and offered this observation:</p><p>The film’s most startling shots are those in which Snyder reimagines the iconic image of Superman in flight. Snyder gives him a vapor trail, like a de-orbiting space-shuttle, and he makes the camera appear to have a hard time keeping Superman in focus…Where Christopher Reeve played Superman with the winning, bemused confidence that comes with the knowledge that one lifted a truck as a baby, Cavill gives Superman an air of injured curiosity: he’s smarting at being misunderstood, but still hopeful that humanity will one day accept him.</p><p>Not only that, but movie’s impending release gives us an opportunity to present this gallery featuring the six actors who have played Superman in movies and on television.</p><p>.</p><h2>Kirk Alyn – The Original Hero</h2><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="SUPERMAN, (Serial), Kirk Alyn, 1948." src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/entertainment.time.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/06/130617099576.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everett<p><b></b><span><b>He wore the cape in:</b></span><br>Two 15-part film serials —&nbsp;<i>Superman</i>&nbsp;(1948)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Atom Man vs. Superman</i>&nbsp;(1950)</p><p><b></b><b><span>Before he played Superman…</span><br></b>Alyn was a song-and-dance man who performed in vaudeville and in<br>supporting roles on <a href=#>Broadway</a></p><p><b></b><span><b>His super-antagonists:</b></span><br>Spider Lady in the first series; Lex Luthor (a.k.a.
