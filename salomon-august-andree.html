 Biography: Salomon August Andrée led an ill-fated attempt to reach the North Pole by hydrogen balloon in 1897. His expedition fascinated the public but ultimately ended in tragedy.
Andrée studied mechanical engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, graduating in 1874. A trip to the United States in 1876 sparked his interest in balloon travel after meeting American balloonist John Wise."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A trip to the United States in 1876 sparked his interest in balloon travel after meeting American balloonist John Wise. In 1882, Andrée participated in a Swedish scientific expedition to Spitsbergen, where he conducted observations on air electricity.</p><p>His ambitious plan to reach the North Pole by balloon gained support from prominent figures, including <a href=#>King Oscar II</a> and <a href=#>Alfred Nobel</a>. The expedition, originally planned for 1896, was delayed due to unfavorable winds. On July 11, 1897, Andrée and his companions Knut Frænkel and Nils Strindberg finally set off in their balloon, named Örnen (The Eagle).</p><p>The journey quickly encountered problems. The balloon lost two of its three steering ropes at lift-off and was caught in a storm within hours. After 65 hours of flight, the team was forced to land on pack ice. They then struggled across the ice for months before reaching Kvitøya (White Island) in early October, where they perished within weeks.</p><p>The remains of the expedition were not discovered until 1930 by the Norwegian Bratvaag Expedition. The return of the explorers' bodies to Sweden became a national event, with King Gustaf V delivering an oration. Initially hailed as a hero, Andrée's reputation later faced criticism as people questioned the expedition's planning and his experience.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>October 18</a>, <a href=#>1854</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Gränna, Småland, Sweden<br><b>Age: <a href=#>years old</a></b><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Libra</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Cause of Death:</b> Died stranded on Kvitøya (White Island) in Norway after trying to reach the Arctic by balloon</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Articles and Photos</h2><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/s-a-andree-balloon-1897-sml.jpg width=270 height=225 alt="The Balloon Expedition to the North Pole" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>The Balloon Expedition to the North Pole</h3><span class=linked_text>The discovery of Swedish engineer S.
