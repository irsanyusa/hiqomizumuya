Women and men create families; they leave their parents' homes and join each other to become one and start their own families.</p><p class=align-left>Men and women are equal in the eyes of the Creator. However, among other things, women have a very important role in this world.</p><h3>Definition of mom in the Bible</h3><p class=align-left>What is a mother <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to the Bible</a>? Although there is no explicit definition of mother in the Bible, the Good Book gives us information about what is expected of a mother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49443c94193f87a8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best Christian podcasts for you and your loved ones</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Bible never says that every woman must be a mom one day. However, it says that every woman who's been blessed with motherhood should treat the role with the utmost respect and responsibility.</p><p class=align-left>Women play a unique role in the life of their children. A good mother never hates her motherhood or treats it like a boring routine. She carries a baby within her body, feeds the baby, lulls them and looks after her child until she leaves this world; a mother's love never ends!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/49443c94193f87a8.png><h3>What is a mom: how does the Bible describe her?</h3><p class=align-left>Motherhood is one of the most important roles that the Lord assigned to women. In his letter to Titus, Paul the Apostle says that women are expected to love their husbands and children, be pure-minded, self-controlled, care for the home, and be kind and dutiful to their husbands.</p><p class=align-left>The verse, Titus 2:4-5, reads:</p>Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ec9804516475d4e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33 Bible verses about marriage that will inspire you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is an essential Bible verse about mothers, as it speaks about their role in society. In the same message to Titus, the Greek word <i>"phileoteknos"</i> appears. The term refers to a mother's love, which is different from all other types of love.</p><p class=align-left>The essence of this love is in taking care of the children, supporting them, bringing them up as good people, embracing them when they feel alone, and helping them get through hard times.</p><h3>Bible quotes about mothers</h3><p class=align-left>What does the Bible say about mothers? And what are their roles towards their children? Here is some scripture about mothers' responsibilities towards their children:</p><h4><strong>1. Teach them the commandments</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Deuteronomy 6: 6-7:</p>These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children.

Teach them the Bible's teachings</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Deuteronomy 4:10:</p>Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when he said to me, "Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children."<h4><strong>4. Mould them when they are young</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Proverbs 22:6:</p>Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.<h4><strong>5.

When the wicked thrive, so does sin, but the righteous will see their downfall. Discipline your children, and they will give you peace; they will bring you the delights you desire.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ec9804516475d4e.png><h4><strong>6.

Be their mentors and good examples to them</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Deuteronomy 4:9:</p>Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live.
