When choosing the best outdoor solar lights, there are a few things to consider:</p><h3>Charge</h3><p>Solar lights need plenty of sunlight to properly charge–usually around six to eight hours. Once fully charged, the battery will power the light, and depending if the solar light is constantly on or only turns on because of motion, the light should have power for up to eight hours. Choose a light that can be powered all night long so you don’t find yourself in the dark</p><h3>Brightness</h3><p>Decide the amount of light you’ll need. From a soft glow, a spot light, or an accent light, the brightness of the light will determine which solar lights will work best. If the intent of the solar light is for security, you’ll need a light that is between 50 and 250 lumens. For accent lights, 20 lumens per square foot creates ambient lighting.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Just like traditional outdoor lighting, solar lights come in a variety of styles and are made from a variety of materials. No matter your style and design preference, you’ll find plenty of solar light options.</p><h2 id=how-we-chose-the-best-outdoor-solar-lights>How we chose the best outdoor solar lights</h2><p>We researched solar lights from the most popular brands and selected options based on brightness, charging time, weather resistance, and other factors.</p><h2 id=solar-light-types>Solar light types</h2><p>Typically solar lights fall into three different categories: dusk-to-dawn, motion activated, and timer-controlled.</p><h3>Dusk-to-dawn</h3><p>These are the most common types of solar lights. Dusk-to-dawn lights use sensors to detect sunlight and will automatically illuminate after the sun sets and remain on until the next day when the sun rises again. Because of their design, dusk-to-dawn solar lights work well as decorative lights around a home.</p><h3>Motion-activated</h3><p>To conserve energy, these types of solar lights only activate when motion is sensed. These types of lights are great options for spot and security lights.</p><h3>Timer-controlled</h3><p>These types of solar lights allow you to determine when the lights will turn on and how long the lights will stay on. Often, these settings are controlled from an app.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Why do solar lamps need batteries?</h3><p>If you’re using the sun to power lights, you may be wondering why solar lamps need batteries. Solar lights need batteries to store electrical energy, which can later be used to power the lights at night or when there are periods of low sunlight without a supply of electricity.</p><h3>How many lumens should a solar light be?</h3><p>It can be confusing when choosing solar lights in lumens instead of wattage. Plus, depending on the type of lights you're installing, you’ll need different lumens. Here’s a short list of recommended lumens for common outdoor lights.</p><ul><li>Landscape, garden and pathway lights 50-250 Lumens</li><li>Security lights 700-1400 Lumens</li><li>Decorative lights 50-150 Lumens</li><li>Post lights 100-400 Lumens</li><li>Deck and pergola lights 5-250 Lumens</li></ul><h3>What is the best brand of solar outdoor lights?</h3><p>There are many brands to choose from and you’ll ultimately want to choose a brand that creates a product that works for you and your outdoor space. Some of the most highly reviewed brands are Westinghouse and Hampton Bay.</p><h3>What wattage is best for solar lights?</h3><p>The best wattage for solar lights really depends on how you intend on using the lights. Solar lights are often measured in lumens. Typically 100-200 lumens or 40 watts is a great option for solar lights that line walkways and driveways. For lights that cover a broader area, choose 1100 lumens or 80 watts to ensure the space is properly lit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1ln6rBpbvOq2Ssp5yWv264yKCfratf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
