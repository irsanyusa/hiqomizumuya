Although she was eliminated in the finals, she holds the title of “Youngest Finalist” ever. Now, she is 19 years old, studying public policy at Duke University, and she’s ready to reintroduce herself to the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kaitlyn-maher-calls-miss-mistake-a-love-letter-to-my-younger-self>Kaitlyn Maher Calls ‘Miss Mistake’ a “Love Letter to My Younger Self”</h2><p>Maher’s newest release has a totally different vibe than “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Friend Salary</a>.” Her September 2023 single features a quicker lyric line, while “Miss Mistake” offers a more intimate, singer-songwriter, approach, genre wise. It brings the listener throughout the journey of growing up. While explaining the track, Maher said that the intention of “Miss Mistake” wasn’t to “be too depressing or sad.” Instead, she strove for a vulnerable, yet uplifting vibe.</p><p>“Miss Mistake” follows a young girl, on the journey of growing up, “on the school bus, and then going into high school, and then into her college bedroom and all the way into young adulthood.” The tune discusses the mental struggles that each person goes through.</p><p>“Everyone has insecurities, everyone fears that they’re not good enough,” she said.&nbsp;“The song is basically a message of purpose and hope that you’re not a ‘misfit mistake.’&nbsp;It doesn’t matter what other people say about you, there will be better moments.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The song hopes to remind its listeners that “you have purpose and you’re never too far gone, and it’s never too late to discover your purpose.” Maher was inspired to write this song after observing “people in my life” who were “being really hard on themselves.”</p><p>Since these feelings are so relatable, Maher explained that she reached deep during its creation.</p><p>“I know what it’s like to be your own biggest critic,” she said.&nbsp;“I know what it’s like to obsess over your every move and think that everyone’s watching and everyone cares.”</p><p>In turn, the song is titled “Miss Mistake” because it’s all about how “nothing about you is accidental and you’re perfect just the way you are.” We all need that reminder sometimes, and that reassurance is exactly what Maher hopes to share on a large scale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-was-purposeful-with-this-release>She Was “Purposeful” With This Release</h2><p>It’s no secret that Kaitlyn Maher has taken some time away from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">music industry</a>, but she’s back now and better than ever. Maher’s most recent singles definitely define her sound as a singer/songwriter, which is her ultimate goal.</p><p>“I’m releasing music now at a time that I’m really ready to. I think I’ve really grown as a songwriter and as an artist,” she said while discussing “Good Friend Salary.” “I remember in high school thinking to myself that if I released music again, I wanted it to be things that I had 100% completely written myself, because I love songwriting.”</p><p>When it comes to Maher’s songwriting, she hopes to produce tracks that resonates, which is “something I’ve always strived to do.”</p><p>“I want people to feel something.&nbsp;And when you have the ability and the platform to speak to people, by all means, you have to speak to people,” she said.&nbsp;“It’s just my mentality. I think that it is a gift to be able to relate to people and to use your own experiences to uplift them.&nbsp;If I’m going through a rough time and I write a song about it, who knows if me going through that rough time is intended to be something that I can channel into hope for somebody else who’s going through that hard time later, or even just like a silly experience.”</p><p>While writing music, Maher is finding inspiration in her own struggles and forming her songs around empathy. She thinks it’s important to remember that “you’re not the only one feeling this way and you’re not a mistake.”</p><p><strong>LISTEN HERE FOR MORE:</strong></p><figure class=wp-block-audio></figure><p>“Miss Mistake” is now available to stream on Apple Music, Spotify, and more.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_DrewBarrymore_RossMatthews_CBS-220x147.jpeg alt="‘The Drew Barrymore Show’ Season 4 Premiere Date Announced After Strike Delay, WGA Writers Refuse to Return" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqgraSpo3qurceeqWaqlaGyor%2FErGSlp6aaeq2x062cq2WkpHquxYyypq6ml5q%2Fbr%2FEpZ1mrJmpuaawjKagrKtdora0wMCknGadqJi5tr%2FIr5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
