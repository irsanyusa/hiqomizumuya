The team is comprised of a mix of highly skilled local and international full time and visiting consultants, setting a benchmark that will enhance the long-term sustainability of the country’s healthcare ecosystem for both patients and practitioners.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Speaking during the commissioning, His Excellency, the Vice President, The Federal Republic of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo said:</strong> “The opening of Evercare Hospital in Nigeria marks an exciting moment for healthcare in Nigeria. This is not just because of the several groundbreaking innovations that come with the package, but perhaps even more for what this holds for the future of medical care in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa as the business landscape for medical care becomes wider.</p><p>"The fact that Evercare chose to invest in Nigeria with the Evercare one-billion-dollar ($1 billion) emerging market health fund, truly confirms that we are seeing the birth of what will be one of the fastest growing areas in the Nigerian economy. This will help us reverse the trend of outbound medical tourism and become a place of choice for specialised procedure in healthcare.”</p><p><strong>Also speaking, the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu said:</strong> “The launch of Evercare in Nigeria speaks to what we stand for in our Government. We have an economic agenda known as “THEMES” agenda and the second pillar of that agenda is Health and Environment. It is not a coincidence that we are aligned with this transformation in our health sector.</p><p>"We believe that health is one of the strongest human capital needs any government should provide and we are willing to create an enabling environment for healthcare providers to strive. Last year was quite difficult for us and even at that our health budget was the only one we increased because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is part of the dedication we have for the health of our people”</p><p><strong>The Chairman, Evercare Hospital Lekki, Tosin Runsewe, also said:</strong> “Evercare Hospital Lekki is determined to transform the healthcare sector by focusing on delivering value based, and accessible quality care to Nigeria. This project which is impact based, has created hundreds of jobs, thereby positively affecting the economy and nation at large. Evercare Hospital Lekki has no doubt invested in a community of diverse, qualified and service driven people to provide the best quality affordable care to its patients.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“The hospital shall strive to meet best in class standards, with a patient centric approach to care. A robust clinical governance process has been implemented to ensure continuous quality improvement and the adherence to international standards for ethics and compliance.” <strong>The Chief Executive Officer, Evercare Hospital Lekki, Rajeev Bhandari,</strong> added.</p><p>The hospital has a strategic focus to employ and retain local talent while also developing skill sets through international expertise. This commitment is to ensure a highly experienced, well-rounded, and diverse team, poised to support the advancement of medical care across Nigeria and reduce the need to travel internationally for medical care.</p><p>Evercare Hospital Lekki has partnered with leading HMOs in Nigeria including Axa Mansard, Total Health Trust Liberty Blue, Avon HMO, Oceanic Health, Bastion HMO and Leadway Health.
