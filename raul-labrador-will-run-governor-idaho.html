Raúl Labrador said Tuesday he would forgo a re-election campaign and run for governor of Idaho.
The Idaho Republican quietly filed initial paperwork for the job Tuesday morning, The Spokesman-Review reported, and announced his plans soon after.
“Idaho needs a proven conservative leader who will stand against the special interests and politicians that have picked the winners and losers in our state capitol for too long,” he said in a statement."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Raúl Labrador said&nbsp;Tuesday he would&nbsp;forgo a re-election campaign and run for governor of Idaho.</p><p>The Idaho Republican quietly filed initial paperwork for the job Tuesday morning, <a href=#>The Spokesman-Review reported</a>, and announced his plans soon after.</p><p>“Idaho needs a proven conservative leader who will stand against the special interests and politicians that have picked the winners and losers in our state capitol for too long,” he said in a statement.</p><p>First elected to Congress in the 2010 Republican&nbsp;wave, Labrador was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus — the group of roughly 30 hard-line conservatives that helped oust former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) in 2015 and&nbsp;has leveraged its voting bloc to move the GOP conference’s American Health Care Act&nbsp;to the right in recent months.</p><p>Labrador&nbsp;was the subject of&nbsp;national headlines over the weekend&nbsp;for saying&nbsp;at a town hall Friday that “nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care.” He later explained his comments in a <a href=#>post on Facebook</a>, saying&nbsp;the remarks were not “very elegant.”</p><p>Labrador will not be alone in the race to replace Republican Gov. Butch Otter, who is not seeking another term. According to <a href=#>The Spokesman-Review</a>, three other Republicans are already in the running ahead of next year’s contest.</p><p>Idaho’s 1st District, which mainly covers the&nbsp;western part of the state, has been reliably red since Labrador was elected in 2010. After winning the seat with 51 percent of the vote, beating Democratic Rep.&nbsp;Walt Minnick by 10 points, he has&nbsp;coasted to re-election, garnering at least 63 percent&nbsp;in each subsequent race.</p><p>Labrador is one of a handful of members of Congress who have announced gubernatorial campaigns, including &nbsp;Reps. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.), Kristi Noem (R-S.D.), Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), Jim Renacci (R-Ohio) and Tim Walz (D-Minn.).</p><p>On Tuesday, another possible gubernatorial candidate — Rep. Dan Kildee of Michigan — <a href=#>said he would stay in Congress</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxgY5pcGiqkaq5brjAm6manJ%2Bneri1y6Vkq62eYrSwwsSrpaiqXZ6xorTOaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
