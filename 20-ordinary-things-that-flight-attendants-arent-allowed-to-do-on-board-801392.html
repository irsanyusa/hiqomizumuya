It&nbsp;is&nbsp;not the usual 9&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;<a href=# title=job data-link=tag>job</a>, that’s for sure, but this job comes with its own perks. If&nbsp;you’ve ever wondered about becoming a&nbsp;flight attendant or&nbsp;were fascinated with the intricacies of&nbsp;the job, then read our article below.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>was curious about what flight attendants are not allowed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;and so&nbsp;we&nbsp;asked them to&nbsp;help&nbsp;us answer some questions.</p><p><h2>1. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;slouch.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a47/8f3/356feb51f4b462b983525fc399.jpg><p>Flight attendants spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time standing, which might cause them to&nbsp;experience back pain, especially on&nbsp;longer flights. Even when they are doing the service in&nbsp;the cabin, they are not supposed <a href=#>to&nbsp;slouch</a>. It&nbsp;might relieve them of&nbsp;their pain for a&nbsp;moment and it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;relaxing, but it&nbsp;doesn’t look professional to&nbsp;stand in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lazy, sloppy way.</p><p>Slouching is&nbsp;not permitted starting in&nbsp;the airport, or&nbsp;wherever they are wearing the uniform. Some airlines also have a&nbsp;restriction regarding hands in&nbsp;pockets or&nbsp;the crossing of&nbsp;their arms.</p><p><h2>2. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;use heavy perfumes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/961/5a1/e8f11f576081b8501b06b1ada7.jpg><p><a href=# title=Hygiene data-link=tag>Hygiene</a> is&nbsp;very strict in&nbsp;the aviation industry, and flight attendants always need to&nbsp;look neat. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, they have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;careful about which <a href=# title=perfume data-link=tag>perfume</a> they use. Although they might be&nbsp;wearing our favorites, if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very heavy scent it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;uncomfortable for other passengers, their colleagues, or&nbsp;even for the pilots, when they interact with them.</p><p><h2>3. They aren’t supposed to&nbsp;lift your bag.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/52b/487/dedd2351a6927653033bf9ae2d.jpg><p>They are not allowed to&nbsp;lift passengers’ bags, and doing so&nbsp;would be&nbsp;very detrimental to&nbsp;their health. They are supposed&nbsp;to (and happily&nbsp;do) assist you with putting your bag up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the overhead lockers, from a&nbsp;coaching perspective. But it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not their job to&nbsp;stow your luggage&nbsp;— doing this for 200 passengers on&nbsp;each flight, 4&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day, would seriously affect their back.</p><p><h2>4. They aren’t supposed to&nbsp;run down the aisle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b76/e2a/fcb2665ce2803a7aca992114cb.jpg><p>Flight attendants try their best to&nbsp;deliver the best service on&nbsp;board, but there might be&nbsp;situations where they are running out of&nbsp;time, like on&nbsp;shorter flights for example, and they have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;things to&nbsp;take care&nbsp;of. Even&nbsp;so, they are not allowed to&nbsp;run down the aisle going from the front galley to&nbsp;the back galley. It&nbsp;doesn’t look good in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the passengers and they might also stumble and fall.</p><p><h2>5. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;eat or&nbsp;drink in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the passengers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/694/223/d056ff5f148080de677579b750.jpg><p>The cabin crew are human too. And they also need their nutrients to&nbsp;function properly at&nbsp;35,000&nbsp;feet. But we&nbsp;try to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;the passengers’ sight. In&nbsp;most airplanes, galleys are separated from the cabin by&nbsp;a&nbsp;curtain. If&nbsp;you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the toilet and see the curtain pulled, that means the flight attendants from your flight are having their lunch break or&nbsp;nightly meal.</p><p><h2>6. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;use headphones.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;crying baby next to&nbsp;you or&nbsp;a&nbsp;loud talker, you might be&nbsp;tempted to&nbsp;put your headphones or&nbsp;earphones on&nbsp;and cancel out the noise. Flight attendants can’t do&nbsp;that. Their ears are valuable assets for your safety.</p><p>They need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;hear everything in&nbsp;the cabin and they actually have specific sounds that depict emergencies, lavatory smoke, and passenger calls. They also undergo an&nbsp;ear test during their medical exam when they renew their license.</p><p><h2>7. They can’t be&nbsp;too short or&nbsp;too tall.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5d9/965/e9182a5997ba9f3a560c8ade97.jpg><p>Although in&nbsp;the past there was a&nbsp;height restriction, this is&nbsp;not the case anymore. However, depending on&nbsp;the company, some might still have some requirements. The most common one is&nbsp;that if&nbsp;the potential flight attendants are too short to&nbsp;open the overhead locker, they cannot be&nbsp;hired as&nbsp;they will not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;take out luggage or&nbsp;retrieve medical kits from there.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, if&nbsp;they are too tall, some emergency procedures might be&nbsp;impractical for them, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;again a&nbsp;“no-go.” Some companies just <a href=#>measure</a> height, others have an&nbsp;arm reach test on&nbsp;the selection day.</p><p><h2>8. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;wear too much jewelry.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e6/109/96239c595c9f6bf8e9e5e7c56e.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule that changes from airline to&nbsp;airline, but very bulky and showy rings or&nbsp;necklaces are prohibited. They are only allowed to&nbsp;wear small and discrete jewelry, like one or&nbsp;2&nbsp;rings, one small necklace, and discreet earrings. Big hoops or&nbsp;dangly earrings might impede them from using some equipment, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;safety issue. Piercings and nose rings are out of&nbsp;the question.</p><p><h2>9. They are obligated to&nbsp;always wear a&nbsp;watch.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc1/a77/0fd55d5b54a44805b334567bb7.jpg><p>Time is&nbsp;crucial. They always need to&nbsp;know the time to&nbsp;reach the aircraft, to&nbsp;board, to&nbsp;start the service, to&nbsp;disembark. Basically, they need it&nbsp;for all of&nbsp;their duties. They are obligated to&nbsp;wear one at&nbsp;all times, and it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;analog, showing seconds, because they need it&nbsp;for emergency situations.</p><p>Smartwatches are allowed, but they have to&nbsp;carry a&nbsp;second <a href=# title=watch data-link=tag>watch</a> in&nbsp;their bag at&nbsp;all times. Fancy, shiny ones are prohibited.</p><p><h2>10. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;have tattoos.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f08/075/3634af5740b764c304ff07a533.jpg><p>This changes from company to&nbsp;<a href=#>company</a>, but the common requirement is&nbsp;that they are not allowed to&nbsp;have any visible tattoos. Visible basically means any part of&nbsp;the body not covered by&nbsp;the uniform, which can mean arms, legs, neck, or&nbsp;face.</p><p><h2>11. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;accept tips.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f49/4e2/bd0d1a538d99cc13df3444eecb.jpg><p>Being in&nbsp;an&nbsp;airplane is&nbsp;not the same as&nbsp;being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant. They are not allowed to&nbsp;accept <a href=# title=tips data-link=tag>tips</a> since their main reason for being there is&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep everyone safe, the food and drink service comes in&nbsp;second place. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;show your appreciation toward them, just be&nbsp;nice, friendly, and polite.</p><p><h2>12. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;sleep during flights.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eea/a1b/14e94756c4b83cf8b611e99cbc.jpg><p>It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;tiring job jumping from time zone to&nbsp;time zone, but even&nbsp;so, they are not allowed to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the missing hours on&nbsp;their flights. There is&nbsp;an&nbsp;exception though. If&nbsp;flight attendants are operating long flights, like transcontinental ones, they have their own sleeping area and they are actually obligated to&nbsp;take <a href=#>rest time</a>. These crews usually work in&nbsp;shifts.</p><p><h2>13. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;not wear makeup.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ba/3c2/e829ad507993004e41e41edfaf.jpg><p>Female flight attendants aren’t allowed to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;a&nbsp;flight with a&nbsp;bare face, meaning no&nbsp;makeup. But they should also be&nbsp;mindful and not come with really intense makeup. Their makeup should look natural, no&nbsp;black lipstick and/or smoky eyes are allowed.</p><p><h2>14. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;black manicure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d9/af9/44cc1558d4a63f63a459dc7f1a.jpg><p>Manicures are very important for flight attendants since they interact with the passengers a&nbsp;lot. So&nbsp;their nails should be&nbsp;always short, clean, neat, and well taken care&nbsp;of. Some companies even have rules on&nbsp;what color the manicure should&nbsp;be, no&nbsp;crazy colors or&nbsp;long shapes, and black is&nbsp;a&nbsp;“no-go.”</p><p><h2>15. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;wear their hair down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61e/9bb/dd989d5be6911fc4cac3c9b313.jpg><p>Hair below the shoulder should always be&nbsp;tied up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bun or&nbsp;a&nbsp;ponytail. Some have stricter rules and only buns are allowed. Hair has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;clean, neat, and tidy at&nbsp;all times. Crazy coiffures, dreadlocks, or&nbsp;buns up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the head are usually not permitted.</p><p><h2>16. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;have crazy hair colors.</h2></p><p>The color of&nbsp;their hair also falls under restrictions. Only natural colors are allowed, no&nbsp;pink or&nbsp;green hair. There are flight attendants who dye their hair, but they have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very careful with their roots. Grown-out roots and different colors in&nbsp;their hair are not allowed.</p><p><h2>17. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;have long beards.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/805/b32/b1deb1568baad7fc053078fcc2.jpg><p>For male flight attendants, grooming is&nbsp;a&nbsp;must. Crazy styles or&nbsp;long beards are not allowed, only short, discreet, and well-groomed beards are permitted. Some companies are even stricter and don’t allow beards at&nbsp;all&nbsp;— they’re only allowed if&nbsp;they are there to&nbsp;hide facial <a href=#>imperfections</a>.</p><p><h2>18. Their skirts can be&nbsp;no&nbsp;shorter than knee-length.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/743/868/aa905f5121a1aa9a8286c83296.jpg><p>The length of&nbsp;the skirt is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big thing to&nbsp;an&nbsp;airline. Female flight attendants are not allowed to&nbsp;have skirts or&nbsp;dresses (and we&nbsp;are talking here about the uniform) shorter than the knee level. Because when you sit down, it&nbsp;goes even higher.</p><p><h2>19. They have to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;impeccable smile.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6aa/883/d3e8985ef680aa1d8c9cafdb25.jpg><p>A&nbsp;flight attendants’ smile is&nbsp;the first thing that passengers see while they board. So&nbsp;their teeth should be&nbsp;clean, and neat, with no&nbsp;missing or&nbsp;impaired teeth. Braces are allowed.</p><p><h2>20. They aren’t allowed to&nbsp;scream or&nbsp;use bad words.</h2></p><p>At&nbsp;all times, the tone of&nbsp;their voice should be&nbsp;irreproachable. They cannot talk loud while in&nbsp;the galley, especially during night flights when the lights should be&nbsp;off and when people are sleeping. They are not allowed to&nbsp;scream either. They are supposed to&nbsp;avoid accents or&nbsp;slang and they always have to&nbsp;exhibit good manners.</p><p><h2>21. They must behave while in&nbsp;uniform.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b45/d89/fc32db55f186d56fd2ae35e7fb.jpg><p>While they are wearing the uniform, they are not permitted to&nbsp;behave in&nbsp;any disrespectful way. They represent the airline and its principles, so&nbsp;any swearing, smoking, screaming, or&nbsp;other contemptuous behavior is&nbsp;completely prohibited. This even includes chewing gum.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;the things above blew your mind and made you say “Wow, they can’t do&nbsp;that&nbsp;— I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea”?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9xec6rm6KmkafGbsDHoqWgq12ptaLAjJ%2Bjop%2BYqXqiwNOepZ2ZnqnAbq3RnqWtZZGhubDDxJ1kraddmbxuu81mmaiZopl6eXyQbHBrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
