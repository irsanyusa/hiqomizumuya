Monica became successful after&nbsp;30, became a&nbsp;mother at&nbsp;almost&nbsp;40, and she proves that a&nbsp;woman is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;creating her own destiny.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;reminisce about the path of&nbsp;this talented actress and find out why she is&nbsp;<a href=# title=loved data-link=tag>loved</a> by&nbsp;so&nbsp;many.</p><p><h2>From the Faculty of&nbsp;Law to&nbsp;fashion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54f/d21/c3684b57ee97d9988a94d3d388.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her youth, Monica dreamed of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;lawyer and even <a href=#>entered</a> the Faculty of&nbsp;Law. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;student, she had a&nbsp;part-time job at&nbsp;a&nbsp;modeling agency. She was noticed there and invited to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Milan. So, she said goodbye to&nbsp;her dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;lawyer and went to&nbsp;conquer the famous <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> houses.</p><p>It’s unbelievable, but <strong>Bellucci’s popularity grew alongside her age</strong>. If&nbsp;at&nbsp;the dawn of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> she starred in&nbsp;commercials and walked on&nbsp;the runway, in&nbsp;her prime, she was on&nbsp;the covers of&nbsp;magazines, starring in&nbsp;iconic <a href=# title=movies data-link=tag>movies</a>, and gaining the status of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most attractive women on&nbsp;the planet. The actress is&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;her age. One day she <a href=#>said</a>: <strong>“I&nbsp;wouldn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;20&nbsp;again for anything.”</strong></p><p><h2>Great career after&nbsp;30</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fb/ff0/0fbe3151e684d188c7e6196c06.jpg><p>Monica’s first movie was <a href=#>Vita coi figli</a> when she was about&nbsp;25, but she was internationally recognized after playing the role of&nbsp;Dracula’s bride in&nbsp;Francis Ford Coppola’s <a href=#>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</a>. But her most remarkable movie became <a href=#>Malèna</a>, a&nbsp;movie about a&nbsp;woman with stunning beauty for which she was hated by&nbsp;the entire town. <strong>At&nbsp;that time, Bellucci was 36&nbsp;years old.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac5/470/6acf4555d7a01376bf2beaad5c.jpg><p>Monica <a href=#>scoffs </a>at&nbsp;the suggestion that actresses can no&nbsp;longer play love interests after a&nbsp;certain age. And she proves it&nbsp;in&nbsp;practice. <strong>At&nbsp;51, she became the most mature girlfriend of&nbsp;James Bond</strong> in&nbsp;Specter, and a&nbsp;year later she starred in&nbsp;Emir Kusturica’s On&nbsp;the Milky Road playing the love interest of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Serbian milkman.</p><p>Since the late 1990s, almost every film where Monica appeared has become iconic. The drama L’Appartement <a href=#>brought</a> Bellucci her first César Award nomination and made her position in&nbsp;the movie industry stronger. During that movie production, she met Vincent Cassel, and their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> became really important for Bellucci.</p><p><h2>Marriage with a&nbsp;heartbreaker who couldn’t be&nbsp;trusted</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/55b/204/a1469c5c608b579a0335837237.jpg><p>“It&nbsp;wasn’t love at&nbsp;first sight. Yes, I&nbsp;found Vincent attractive, but&nbsp;I felt that&nbsp;I couldn’t trust him or&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;him.”</p><p>Bellucci and Cassel spent 17&nbsp;years together, 12&nbsp;of&nbsp;which they were married. The couple took their time in&nbsp;making their relationship official&nbsp;— both of&nbsp;them pursued their acting career, and due to&nbsp;frequent traveling and filming, their love developed from a&nbsp;distance. <strong>Monica gave birth to&nbsp;their first daughter at&nbsp;39</strong>.</p><p>Monica and Vincent’s second daughter was born when the actress was&nbsp;45, and 3&nbsp;years later the couple <a href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;get separated. Shortly before the breakup, Bellucci said, “Marriage, we&nbsp;never know how long it&nbsp;will last...Today, it&nbsp;works, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;year, I&nbsp;don’t know.”</p><p>There is&nbsp;still speculation about what the reasons for the couple’s separation were. Both Vincent and Monica spoke very respectfully of&nbsp;each other during interviews about their breakup, and they didn’t say anything bad about their relationship. However, the actress <a href=#>mentioned</a> that she never felt confident about her husband and couldn’t trust him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4a4/15e/b0dc8f50eeb3d6705fba666fc3.jpg><p>After breaking up&nbsp;with Monica, Cassel began to&nbsp;date a&nbsp;French model Tina Kunakey, who is&nbsp;30&nbsp;years younger than the actor. Later, their romance grew into a&nbsp;strong marriage. Monica, in&nbsp;turn, decided to&nbsp;enter into a&nbsp;new relationship after only a&nbsp;few years when <strong>French artist Nicolas Lefebvre became her <a href=#>boyfriend</a>.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately or&nbsp;fortunately, Bellucci and Lefebvre’s romantic relationship didn’t last long, and they decided to&nbsp;remain friends. Despite this fact, Monica claims that she’s now living the best years of&nbsp;her life. And in&nbsp;bad weather, her beloved work and beautiful daughters keep her warm. Her eldest daughter Deva looks very much like her mother.</p><p><h2>Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;be&nbsp;beautiful after&nbsp;50?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da9/6e3/3a358f52a9a65ac9bbfe51c948.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her photos, Monica looks&nbsp;10, or&nbsp;even 20&nbsp;years younger than her age. Besides, the actress is&nbsp;so&nbsp;self-confident that <strong>she agreed to<a href=#>&nbsp;participate</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;nude scene at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;52.</strong> After that, she <a href=#>dared</a> to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;nude photoshoot for the cover of&nbsp;a&nbsp;glossy magazine.</p><p>Nowadays, Bellucci continues to&nbsp;act in&nbsp;movies and remains a&nbsp;sought-after model. To&nbsp;stay young and beautiful, she recommends the following rules:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair no&nbsp;more than twice a&nbsp;week and <a href=#>use</a> olive oil instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mask.</li><li>Never limit your food. However, if&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;lose a&nbsp;few pounds, make your portions smaller and eat more meat, fish, and vegetables.</li><li>Do&nbsp;yoga and swim. These exercises keep your body toned without excessive training.</li><li><a href=#>Clean </a>your facial skin thoroughly before going to&nbsp;bed, no&nbsp;matter how sleepy you are.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a85/e3f/4b5fb4519bbfbe85f931ed45b1.jpg><p>What is&nbsp;your favorite Monica Bellucci movie?
